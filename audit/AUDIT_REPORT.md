# Sophis — Pre-Testnet Audit Report

**Started:** 2026-05-14
**Auditor:** Claude Code (Opus 4.7, 1M context)
**Scope:** Complete workspace audit before official testnet launch
**Format:** Monolithic report (per founder decision 2026-05-14)
**Cadence:** Multi-session (1-2 weeks)

> **Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS — Session 1 (baseline + inventory)

---

## 0. Methodology

This audit categorizes the workspace into four Tiers by blast radius. A bug in Tier 0 corrupts consensus and is permanently fatal; a bug in Tier 3 is cosmetic. The audit treats them with proportional rigor:

- **Tier 0 — Consensus-critical.** Function-by-function, parameter-by-parameter, every public API and every invariant. Goal: 100% test coverage on consensus paths, every error variant exercised, every constant proven derivation-correct, every panic path justified.
- **Tier 1 — Operational security.** sVM host capabilities, wallet/signing, RPC auth, mining manager, anti-long-range-attack. Each capability covered with positive + adversarial test. Each panic path traced. Each unsafe block justified.
- **Tier 2 — ZK plumbing.** Phase 3 rollup + Phase 5 oracle (deprecated) + Phase 6 DA + Phase 9 PQC oracle. Witness/AIR correctness already covered by RFC/FIPS vectors; audit focuses on wire format invariants, prover/verifier mismatches, dispatch fan-out.
- **Tier 3 — UX/infra.** Faucet, explorer, dashboard, calculator, da-stress, dnsseeder. Smoke tests + obvious safety; not blocking.

Each session below either appends new findings or updates the Veredito section. Findings are classed:
- **P0** — must fix before testnet launch
- **P1** — must fix before mainnet launch
- **P2** — post-mainnet technical debt
- **OK** — confirmed correct under audit, no action needed

## 1. Baseline (Session 1, 2026-05-14)

### 1.1 Repo state

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository | `C:\Projetos\sophis\` |
| Branch | `main` |
| HEAD | `a83bf79` (docs: CLAUDE.md — expand prod infra section) |
| Untracked | `Whitepaper.pdf` (1 file) |
| Working tree | otherwise clean |
| Rust | 1.94.1 (rustc 1.94.1, cargo 1.94.1) |
| Toolchain reqs | LLVM 22+, MSVC Build Tools 2022, protoc, CMake 4.3+ |
| Workspace edition | 2024 |
| Workspace version | `1.1.0` |
| License | Apache-2.0 |

> ⚠️ **Drift vs. project CLAUDE.md:** project CLAUDE.md references `1eead7b` as HEAD ("ROADMAP COMPLETE"). Actual HEAD = `a83bf79`, a docs-only commit *after* the roadmap closer. The roadmap commit `1eead7b` is preserved in history. This is not a regression — it is documentation drift to be re-synced before audit closure.

### 1.2 Workspace inventory

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| Workspace members (Cargo.toml) | **75 crates** + 1 guest workspace (`rollup/host/guest`) |
| Rust source files (excluding `target/`) | **986** |
| Lines of Rust code (excluding `target/`) | **178,745** |
| Test attributes (`#[test]`, `#[tokio::test]`, `#[wasm_bindgen_test]`) | **1,897 in 282 files** |
| `unsafe` blocks/fns/impls | **54 occurrences in 27 files** ⚠️ (must justify each) |
| `pub fn`/`pub async fn`/`pub const fn` (line-start regex; impl-block pubs not counted) | **638 in 233 files** (lower bound) |

> ℹ️ Project CLAUDE.md mentions "414/414 verdes + 4 ignored slow" for Phase 5 oracle scope only. Workspace-wide totals collected here are larger and include integration, sVM, consensus, RPC, wallet, mining, etc.

### 1.5 Baseline test/compile results

| Step | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Compile workspace (Windows, all defaults) | `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` | ❌ **FAILS — known risc0/MSVC issue, expected (§1.5.1)** |
| Compile workspace (Windows, excluding risc0 host crates) | `cargo check --workspace --all-targets --exclude sophis-rollup-host --exclude rollup-node` | ✅ **exit 0 in 1m00s, 99 crates, zero warnings** |
| Workspace test suite | `cargo test --workspace --exclude sophis-rollup-host --exclude rollup-node --no-fail-fast` | ✅ **exit 0** — **174 suites, 1,914 passed, 0 failed, 65 ignored** (Session 1) — after F-5 fix: 1,917/0/65 with 3 new sign tests |
| Clippy CI invariant | `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --exclude sophis-rollup-host --exclude rollup-node -- -D warnings` | ✅ **exit 0** — **0 errors, 0 warnings, finished in 49.53s** (Session 3, after fixing one regression introduced by F-5 commit; see `3261134` "drop useless `ZERO_HASH.into()`") |
| Test suite (svm-zk / risc0) | `cargo nextest run -p sophis-svm-host --features risc0` | ⏳ Linux Docker only — Session 8/9 |
| Test suite (plonky3 dispatch) | `cargo nextest run -p sophis-svm-host --features plonky3` | ⏳ Session 2 (after coverage) |
| Devnet end-to-end (5 nodes) | `python devnet/test_runner.py --fast-mode` | ✅ **10/10 tests passed, 0 failures** (Session 3, end-to-end Phase 1 Rodada 2) — B1.1 devnet bring-up, B1.2 RandomX mining (~0.30 MH/s), B1.3 Dilithium TX throughput, B2.1 keygen, B2.2 coinbase to Dilithium addr, **B2.3 valid TX accepted, B2.4 tampered TX rejected** (verifier-side integrity check), B3.1 stress with 2 simultaneous wallets, B4.1 genesis hash unit, B4.2 Dilithium sign+verify unit |

**Baseline summary:** 100% test pass rate (1,914/1,914 non-ignored). 65 ignored are documented slow paths (RFC 8032 STARK round-trip and similar, per CLAUDE.md §"Status testes"). Note: this count is *higher* than the 1,897 `#[test]` attribute count from §1.2 because doc-tests and macro-generated test cases also contribute.

#### 1.5.1 Known build limitation on Windows (NOT a regression)

`cargo check --workspace` fails on Windows because of two `risc0-sys`-derived C++ build issues:

```
error: failed to run custom build command for `risc0-circuit-keccak-sys v4.0.2`
  cc-rs: cl.exe exit code 2 (C++ compilation failure under MSVC 14.44)
error: failed to run custom build command for `risc0-circuit-recursion-sys v4.0.2`
error: linking with `link.exe` failed: exit code: 1120
  librisc0_zkvm_platform-...: error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol sys_alloc_aligned
```

This is documented in project CLAUDE.md (`§"Caminho 2 — feature-gate svm-zk"`) and ZKBridge memory file:
> "Construção | Linux Docker (canonical); MSVC trava em risc0 C++20 (bug pré-existente, idêntico Sophis)"

**Impact on audit:** Tier 2 audit of `rollup/host` + `rollup/host/guest` + `--features svm-zk` paths must be done in Linux Docker, not on this Windows machine. This is recorded as a baseline limitation, **not** a finding.

**Next-session task:** stand up Linux Docker build (`docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml run …` or equivalent) and re-run `cargo nextest run --workspace --features svm-zk` to populate the Tier 2 baseline.

### 1.6 Invariants confirmed clean on visual inspection

Performed automated grep over the entire workspace; results triaged manually.

| Invariant (per CLAUDE.md) | Grep / Probe | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Devfund on-chain eliminado | `devfund\|dev_fund\|DEV_FUND\|DevFund` | ✅ **CLEAN.** Single match: a comment in `consensus/src/processes/coinbase.rs:110` documenting removal. No code paths reachable. Also verified: zero hits in `consensus/core/src/config/params.rs` (`MAINNET_PARAMS`, `TESTNET_PARAMS`, `SIMNET_PARAMS`, `DEVNET_PARAMS` all clean). |
| Coinbase 100% to miner | Read `consensus/src/processes/coinbase.rs:97-144` | ✅ **CLEAN.** `expected_coinbase_transaction` pays `reward_data.subsidy + reward_data.total_fees` to each mergeset_blue block's reported script; red rewards pay to current `miner_data.script_public_key`. No split, no devfund recipient. |
| Sem privacidade nativa (FHE / OP_PRIVACY / ring sigs / mixers / confidential) | `fhe\|tfhe\|ring_sig\|mixer\|OP_PRIVACY\|confidential` (case-insensitive) | ✅ **CLEAN.** 4 false positives, all matching substring "fhe" inside `ProofHeader` / `JtfHeader` identifiers (case-insensitive). No FHE code remains. |
| Sem Schnorr / secp256k1 (signatures) | `schnorr\|secp256k1` (case-insensitive) | ✅ **CLEAN.** Zero hits in `.rs` files. Note: project CLAUDE.md observes that `rothschild/Cargo.toml` historically listed `secp256k1` as a dep for keypair derivation residual — not verified this session, will check Tier 1. |
| Sem kHeavyHash (PoW = RandomX only) | `kHeavyHash\|KHeavyHash` (case-insensitive) | ⚠️ **PARTIAL.** See finding F-1 below — `KHeavyHash` still compiled as default-OFF feature fallback. |
| sVM `Capability` enum — Dilithium only signature, no Schnorr | Read `svm/core/src/capability.rs` | ✅ **CLEAN.** 11 variants: `ReadUtxo`, `ProduceOutput`, `VerifyDilithium`, `ReadBlockHeight`, `HashSha3`, `VerifyRisc0Proof`, `VerifyPlonky3Proof`, `VerifyDataAvailability`, `ResolveAlt`, `EmitEvent`, `VrfRandomness`. **No `VerifySchnorr`**. CLAUDE.md lists 8 — drift: 3 variants (`ResolveAlt`, `EmitEvent`, `VrfRandomness`) were added via roadmap items #1/#3/#4 in 2026-05-10 but the doc wasn't updated to enumerate them. Code matches the SIPs (SIP-1 ALT, SIP-3 VRF, SIP-4 Events). |
| ABI-frozen constants — L1 ALT | Read `consensus/core/src/alt/mod.rs:70-102, 752-757` | ✅ **CLEAN.** All 8 constants match CLAUDE.md exactly: `ALT_HEADER_LEN=22`, `ALT_HANDLE_LEN=6`, `MAX_ALT_ENTRIES=256`, `MAX_ALT_ENTRY_SCRIPT_BYTES=4096`, `MAX_ALT_CREATIONS_PER_TX=4`, `MAX_ALT_CREATIONS_PER_BLOCK=16`, `BASE_ALT_CREATION_MASS=100_000`, `ALT_STORAGE_MASS_FACTOR=1`. **Tested with `#[test] fn frozen_constants()` at line 752.** |
| ABI-frozen constants — J4 Events | Read `consensus/core/src/events/mod.rs:45-217` | ✅ **CLEAN.** All match CLAUDE.md: `MAX_TOPICS_PER_EVENT=4`, `TOPIC_LEN=32`, `MAX_EVENT_DATA_BYTES=4096`, `MAX_EVENTS_PER_TX=32`, `MAX_EVENTS_PER_BLOCK=1024`, `MAX_LOGS_PER_RESPONSE=1000`, `EVENTS_BY_CONTRACT_BUCKET_SIZE=65_536`. **Tested with `#[test] fn frozen_constants()` at line 207.** |
| Anti-long-range-attack — two-layer architecture | Files touching `min_chain_work` + `max_chain_work_seen` | ✅ **CLEAN.** Both layers wired: (1) `Params.min_chain_work` constant per network — set to `BlueWorkType::ZERO` for all 4 networks at this initial release (per CLAUDE.md "bumpa release-by-release"); (2) `MaxChainWorkSeen` store in `consensus/src/model/stores/max_chain_work_seen.rs` (prefix 62 in `database/src/registry.rs`). Hot paths: `consensus/src/pipeline/header_processor/processor.rs` (gating), `consensus/src/pipeline/virtual_processor/processor.rs` (floor raise). Tests in `consensus/src/pipeline/virtual_processor/tests.rs`. |
| MAX_SCRIPT_PUBLIC_KEY_VERSION expected = 5 (post Phase 6 carrier bump) | grep `MAX_SCRIPT_PUBLIC_KEY_VERSION` | ⏳ to be confirmed Tier 0 / Phase 6 audit. Project CLAUDE.md older line still says =2; memory `project_phase6_subfase_6_1_v5_carrier.md` says bumped to 5 (with v=3,4 reserved). Drift in doc. |

### 1.7 Findings — Session 1 (preliminary)

#### F-1 — PoW algorithm is a compile-time feature flag, not a consensus rule (P1) ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** P1 — must fix before mainnet launch.
**Found:** Session 1, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** ✅ **fixed in commit `a50706f` (same session, 2026-05-14)**. Adopted Option 1 with a WASM exemption: `compile_error!()` at the top of `consensus/pow/src/lib.rs` gated on `#[cfg(all(not(feature = "randomx"), not(feature = "wasm32-sdk")))]`. Verified:
- `cargo check -p sophis-pow` (default features) → exit 0, compiles in ~57s.
- `cargo check -p sophis-pow --no-default-features` → **fails as expected** with the documented message ("sophis-pow requires either the 'randomx' feature … or the 'wasm32-sdk' feature").
- The WASM browser-display path (`wasm.rs`) is preserved.
- Pre-existing latent warning `unused import: std::sync::Arc` in `lib.rs` only surfaces under the now-blocked path; not user-facing.

**Description.**
`sophis-pow` declares `default = ["randomx"]` and gates the entire RandomX integration behind `#[cfg(feature = "randomx")]`. When the feature is OFF, `State::new`, `State::calculate_pow`, and `State::check_pow` fall back to the legacy `Matrix::heavy_hash` + `PowHash` pipeline (`consensus/pow/src/lib.rs:90-95, 132-139, 210-215`; `consensus/pow/src/matrix.rs:124`).

The downstream crates that depend on `sophis-pow` all explicitly request `features = ["randomx"]` in their `Cargo.toml`:
- `consensus/Cargo.toml:32`
- `miner/Cargo.toml:22`
- `bridge/Cargo.toml:16`
- `testing/integration/Cargo.toml:31`

So **the default `cargo build` of a node binary unambiguously uses RandomX**, and any node operator following the documented build instructions is safe.

**Risk.**
A consumer who builds with `--no-default-features` (e.g., to strip an unrelated default feature without realizing this one is load-bearing) or who depends on `sophis-pow` from an out-of-tree wallet/SDK without explicitly setting `features = ["randomx"]` will get a node that validates PoW using `kHeavyHash`. Such a node would reject every real network block (RandomX hash never satisfies a `kHeavyHash`-derived target) — this is a *fail-stop* outcome, not a silent fork. But it would manifest as confusing "all blocks invalid" errors during testnet launch and could erode trust.

**Recommended fixes (any one of):**
1. **Compile-time guard** in `sophis-pow/src/lib.rs`: add a `#[cfg(not(feature = "randomx"))] compile_error!("Sophis requires the 'randomx' feature; non-default builds are not supported on mainnet/testnet")`. Drops the feature from "optional" to "required without an explicit override token."
2. **Runtime assertion** in `sophisd` startup: log + panic if the binary was built without the `randomx` feature. Acceptable but weaker than (1).
3. **Drop the WASM kHeavyHash fallback** in `consensus/pow/src/wasm.rs` — it is explicitly documented as for browser-only dev/educational use and is not exercised by the production node. Move the WASM PoW story to "browsers must use Stratum to a real miner" without shipping any code that pretends otherwise.

**Audit note:** the existence of this code path *probably* dates back to the Kaspa fork and was never deleted when RandomX was wired in. This is dead-code-by-config rather than a vulnerability, but mainnet should not ship with two compilable PoW algorithms in one binary's source tree.

#### F-2 — Unsafe WASM ABI cast lacks safecast check (P2) ✅ FIXED (partial)

**Severity:** P2 — dívida pós-mainnet (WASM-only path; not exercised by mainnet node).
**Found:** Session 1, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** ✅ **null-pointer reject added in commit `cd53691` (Session 3, 2026-05-14).** Full type-id check intentionally deferred — wasm-bindgen does not expose `try_from_abi` for arbitrary user types; emulating the type-id check would require reimplementing wasm-bindgen's internal reference-table bookkeeping. The null-pointer guard closes the most likely accidental-use-after-free trigger (caller passes a moved-from or un-initialized JS handle). A SAFETY comment documents the residual contract.

**Verification:** `cargo check -p sophis-addresses` exit 0 after fix. Wasm32 builds will exercise the new path; native node/miner/RPC unaffected.

#### F-3 — `sVM Capability` enum has 3 variants not enumerated in project CLAUDE.md (documentation drift only — no code finding) ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** doc-drift (not a code finding).
**Found:** Session 1, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** ✅ **fixed in Session 3, 2026-05-14** — `G:\Meu Drive\Claude\Sophis\CLAUDE.md` updated to list all 11 variants (including `ResolveAlt`, `EmitEvent`, `VrfRandomness`) with their roadmap-item references and the canonical source path `svm/core/src/capability.rs`. The repo `C:\Projetos\sophis\CLAUDE.md` was already correct (line 264).

#### F-4 — `MAX_SCRIPT_PUBLIC_KEY_VERSION` documentation drift (Phase 6 carrier bump) ✅ VERIFIED

**Severity:** doc-drift.
**Found:** Session 1, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** ✅ **verified in code (Session 3).** Action item: update CLAUDE.md at audit closure.

**Code reality (verified by direct grep):**
- `consensus/core/src/constants.rs:30` defines `pub const MAX_SCRIPT_PUBLIC_KEY_VERSION: u16 = 5` (this is the L1 consensus value — what `ScriptPublicKey.version` is allowed to be on-chain).
- `crypto/txscript/src/lib.rs:59` defines a *separate* `pub const MAX_SCRIPT_PUBLIC_KEY_VERSION: u16 = 0` (this is the version the txscript *engine* knows how to execute; higher versions get the "anyone-can-spend" treatment until activated, à la Bitcoin segwit reserved versions).
- The two constants are documented as intentionally distinct in `crypto/txscript/src/lib.rs:45-59`: *"**Not** the same as `sophis_consensus_core::constants::MAX_SCRIPT_PUBLIC_KEY_VERSION`"*.

**Conclusion:** Code is correct. CLAUDE.md text — *"MAX_SCRIPT_PUBLIC_KEY_VERSION | 2 (puro — sem versions de bridge externa)"* — is **stale on two counts**:
1. The numeric value is **5**, not 2 (bumped in Phase 6 sub-fase 6.1, with v=3,4 reserved for legacy rollup-bridge versions per project memory `project_phase6_subfase_6_1_v5_carrier.md`).
2. The "puro — sem versions de bridge externa" comment dates back to before Phase 6's V5 DA carrier landed and is no longer accurate.

**Recommended fix** (at audit closure): update the `§"Parâmetros da rede"` table in CLAUDE.md.

**Status:** ✅ **fixed in Session 3, 2026-05-14** — `G:\Meu Drive\Claude\Sophis\CLAUDE.md` line 125 updated with the corrected value (`5`), v=1..5 semantics, and a footnote clarifying that the txscript engine pins its own `MAX_SCRIPT_PUBLIC_KEY_VERSION = 0` intentionally. The repo `C:\Projetos\sophis\CLAUDE.md` does not contain the stale line.

## 1.8 Session 1 — closing summary

**Status:** Session 1 of 7 — **structural baseline complete**, test-suite verification pending.

### What's done

- Workspace inventoried (75 crates, 986 files, 178,745 LOC, 1,897 test attributes, 54 unsafe).
- `audit/AUDIT_REPORT.md` created with full Tier 0/1/2/3 structure for Sessions 2-final.
- 7 audit tasks created in the task list.
- `cargo check --workspace --exclude sophis-rollup-host --exclude rollup-node` → ✅ **exit 0 in 1m00s, 99 crates clean, zero warnings**. Windows MSVC risc0 limitation documented (canonical build = Linux Docker, per project memory).
- **9 invariants visually confirmed clean** (devfund eliminated, coinbase 100% miner, no FHE/privacy, no Schnorr/secp256k1 in code, sVM Capability has no `VerifySchnorr`, L1 ALT constants frozen + tested, J4 Events constants frozen + tested, anti-long-range-attack two layers wired, `min_chain_work = ZERO` per network as documented).
- **4 findings filed**: F-1 (P1 PoW compile-time switch), F-2 (P2 WASM ABI), F-3/F-4 (doc drift).

### What's still running

- `cargo test --workspace --exclude sophis-rollup-host --exclude rollup-node --no-fail-fast` (background; was still compiling test binaries at end of Session 1).
  - When complete, this will populate the actual pass/fail count vs the 1,897 attribute target.
  - Tier 2 svm-zk / risc0 tests must be re-run on Linux Docker — separate session.

### Plan for Session 2

Per the per-task dependencies set up:

1. **First**: confirm test-suite result from Session 1's background run (capture in §1.5).
2. Install `cargo-llvm-cov` if missing.
3. Generate workspace coverage → `audit/COVERAGE_MAP.md`.
4. List `pub fn` functions with 0% line coverage, grouped by Tier.
5. Identify which crates have *no* test attributes at all (per §1.2 file-count gap).
6. Save crate-by-crate coverage table back into AUDIT_REPORT.md as §2.0 "Coverage baseline".

### Estimate vs. user's 1-2 week multi-session window

- Session 1: **done in this turn** (baseline + first 4 findings).
- Sessions 2: ~1 turn (coverage map).
- Sessions 3-5: ~3 turns (Tier 0 — biggest crate-by-crate effort).
- Sessions 6-7: ~2 turns (Tier 1).
- Sessions 8-9: ~2 turns (Tier 2 — needs Linux Docker setup).
- Session 10 + final: ~2 turns (Tier 3 + verdict).

Total: ~11 working sessions. Fits comfortably in 1-2 weeks.

### 1.6 Cross-cutting risk markers (raw, to be analyzed in later sessions)

| Risk marker | Count | Audit action |

## 2.0 Coverage baseline (Session 2, 2026-05-14)

Generated with `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --exclude sophis-rollup-host --exclude rollup-node --no-fail-fast --summary-only` (source-based instrumentation, LLVM 22 / `cargo-llvm-cov 0.8.7`). Full per-file table in `audit/coverage_full.txt` (700 lines).

### Workspace totals

- **Regions:** 66.08% (107,808/163,158)
- **Functions:** 59.94% (7,245/12,087) — **~40% of functions have zero coverage**
- **Lines:** 65.88% (60,025/91,116)
- **Branches:** unsupported by `cargo-llvm-cov 0.8.7` on this LLVM build (column reports `-`).

### By Tier

| Tier | Files | Lines covered | Functions covered | Regions covered | Zero-pct files | Sub-50% files |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **T0** — Consensus-critical | 153 | **77.33%** (19,277/24,927) | **68.20%** (2,052/3,009) | 77.10% (33,509/43,461) | 19 | 10 |
| **T1** — Operational security | 256 | **55.70%** (14,483/26,003) | **51.33%** (2,119/4,128) | 54.28% (25,309/46,631) | 76 | 40 |
| **T2** — ZK plumbing | 125 | **84.87%** (17,929/21,125) | **74.04%** (1,842/2,488) | 86.93% (34,980/40,238) | 6 | 7 |
| **T3** — UX/infra | 162 | 43.73% (8,336/19,061) | 50.04% (1,232/2,462) | 42.68% (14,010/32,828) | 52 | 28 |

**Reading.** T2 (ZK plumbing — Phase 3/5/6/9) is the best-tested category, reflecting the FIPS/RFC-grade witness validation and oracle-host AIR test density (~50 chips × multiple tests each). T0 (consensus) is the next-strongest at 77% lines, but has critical zero-pct files (F-5, F-6, F-7 below). T1 (operational) has the largest gap by absolute lines missed (11,520 lines uncovered) — protocol flow handlers and IBD code dominate. T3 low coverage is expected for binaries (faucet, explorer, dashboard, calculator, da-stress all have `main.rs` at 0% — these are exercised by smoke/manual testing, not unit tests).

```

Detailed audit per-file deferred to Tier 1 sessions (6-7). Filed two collected findings here:
- **F-8 (P1)**: zero direct test coverage on Initial Block Download flow + v7 message handlers. IBD security is critical — a bug here lets an adversary stall or corrupt new-node sync.
- **F-9 (P2)**: CLI binaries (`dilithium-wallet`, `miner`) have 1,142 + 250 lines of `main.rs` code with zero direct unit tests. Acceptable if devnet integration tests exercise the user-visible code paths — to confirm in Tier 1.

### Session 2 findings — Tier 0 / Tier 1

#### F-5 — `sign_input_dilithium` has 0% direct test coverage (P0) ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** P0 — must fix before testnet (founder ratified Session 2, 2026-05-14).
**Found:** Session 2, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** ✅ **fixed in commit `1dcbbad` (Session 3, 2026-05-14)**. Added a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block in `consensus/core/src/sign.rs:60-188` with three unit tests:

1. **`test_sign_input_dilithium_round_trip`** — sign a single-input populated tx, verify the 2420-byte signature against the same sighash via `libcrux_ml_dsa::ml_dsa_44::verify`. Closes the sighash-binding / script-encoding bug class.
2. **`test_sign_input_dilithium_sighash_type_binding`** — sign with `SIG_HASH_ALL`, `SIG_HASH_NONE`, `SIG_HASH_SINGLE`; assert the three signatures differ pairwise and that the trailing hash-type byte echoes the requested variant. Closes the "signer ignores SigHashType" bug class.
3. **`test_sign_input_dilithium_randomness_nondeterminism`** — sign the same input twice with the same key; assert signatures differ (ML-DSA is hedged). Pins `libcrux_ml_dsa::SIGNING_RANDOMNESS_SIZE == 32` so a future libcrux upgrade changing the constant fails this test rather than the production signer. Closes the "randomness slice mis-sized" bug class.

Verification: `cargo test -p sophis-consensus-core sign::` → **3 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored**.

The tests reuse the same `PopulatedTransaction` / `Transaction` patterns as `consensus/core/src/hashing/sighash.rs::test_signature_hash`, so future sighash refactors will surface here as well.

**Description.** `consensus/core/src/sign.rs:30-58` defines `sign_input_dilithium`, the canonical function that:
1. Computes the sighash via `calc_signature_hash(tx, input_index, hash_type, &reused_values)`.
2. Loads the 2560-byte Dilithium-2 (ML-DSA-44) signing key into `MLDSA44SigningKey`.
3. Draws 32 bytes of `getrandom::getrandom` for ML-DSA randomness.
4. Calls `ml_dsa_44::sign(&sk, message, b"", randomness)`.
5. Builds the P2SH input script: `[0x4d, sig_len_lo, sig_len_hi, sig_bytes ‖ hash_type_byte]`.

`cargo-llvm-cov` shows **0/22 line coverage, 0/1 function coverage**. The function is called from **9 sites** in 5 binaries (`dilithium-wallet`, `tools/sophis-da-stress`, `testnet-faucet`, `oracle/relayer`, `rollup/sequencer`), and there is no `#[test]` in `consensus/core/src/sign.rs` itself or in any sibling test module that invokes it.

**Why this matters.**
- A bug in sighash binding silently invalidates every signed transaction (caller side) or accepts forged ones (verifier side). The verifier path *is* tested (via opcode `0xc4` Dilithium opcode tests in `txscript`), but the signer is not.
- The randomness sourcing (line 42-45) reads from `getrandom`. A bug that mis-sizes the slice or leaks the secret-key bytes through randomness would be invisible to a happy-path integration test that simply sends and confirms a tx.
- The script encoding (lines 50-56) hand-writes the OP_PUSHDATA2 prefix. A wrong endianness or a 1-byte slip silently produces an unspendable output that the signer cannot tell apart from a normal one.

**P0-vs-P1 rationale.**
- P0 view: this is consensus-critical code with zero test. Testnet should not launch without a round-trip vector.
- P1 view: the verifier side has exhaustive tests (libcrux ML-DSA-44 ships its own NIST-KAT verification) and integration via the rothschild-style traffic generator on devnet implicitly exercises the path. So a *catastrophic* bug would surface in the first 24 hours of testnet via "all txs rejected" symptoms.

**Recommended fix (minimum):** add three unit tests in `consensus/core/src/sign.rs#[cfg(test)]`:
1. **Round-trip** — generate a Dilithium keypair, sign a single-input tx, run the signature through the `txscript` Dilithium opcode verifier (or `libcrux_ml_dsa::ml_dsa_44::verify`), assert it accepts.
2. **SigHashType variation** — sign the same tx with each of the documented SigHashType variants, assert signatures differ.
3. **Determinism / randomness probe** — sign the same tx twice with the same key, assert signatures differ (because randomness is sampled). Bind explicitly to `libcrux::ml_dsa::SIGNING_RANDOMNESS_SIZE` so a future libcrux upgrade that changes the constant fails the test rather than the code.

#### F-6 — `pruning_proof/validate.rs` has 0% test coverage (P1) ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** P1 — must fix before mainnet (testnet-tolerable).
**Found:** Session 2, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** ✅ **fixed in Session 5, 2026-05-14**. Added **2 integration tests** to `testing/integration/src/consensus_integration_tests.rs` (appended after `indirect_parents_test`):

- `validate_pruning_proof_accepts_fresh_node_round_trip` — **positive vector**: builds a 200-block DAG on a "producer" `TestConsensus` (params override identical to the existing `pruning_test`: `finality_depth=2, mergeset_size_limit=2, ghostdag_k=2, merge_depth=3, pruning_depth=100`), waits for the second block to be pruned, extracts the pruning-point proof via `get_pruning_point_proof()`, then spins up a fresh "validator" `TestConsensus` with matching params and asserts that `validate_pruning_proof(&proof, &metadata).is_ok()`. Mirrors the canonical IBD entry on a syncing node.

- `validate_pruning_proof_rejects_truncated_proof` — **negative vector**: same producer setup, then mutates the proof with `proof.pop()` (drops the top `BlockLevel` layer) and asserts that `validate_pruning_proof(&truncated, &metadata).is_err()`. Confirms the validator fails closed rather than silently accepting a malformed proof.

**Run result:** `cargo test -p sophis-testing-integration validate_pruning_proof` → **2 passed / 0 failed in 9.46 s**. Compile + run included.

**Lower-bound revision.** The Session 3 audit-report note estimated the pruning-depth structural lower bound at ~13,094 blocks (from `finality + 2·merge_depth + 4·mergeset·k + 2k + 2` with the *production* `mergeset_size_limit ≥ 180`, `ghostdag_k ≥ 18` floors). That estimate was correct only for the *production* parameter space. The existing `pruning_test` (line 1700 of the same file) had already shown that **`Params` is mutable at test time** (via `ConfigBuilder::edit_consensus_params`) — direct field override bypasses the Bps floors entirely. With `finality_depth=2, pruning_depth=100, mergeset_size_limit=2, ghostdag_k=2`, ~200 blocks is sufficient. The original 4-8h dedicated-session estimate is therefore *vastly* over-revised; F-6 took ~30 minutes including compile-iterate-pass cycles.

**Description.** `consensus/src/processes/pruning_proof/validate.rs` (251 lines, 17 fns) validates incoming pruning-point proofs during Initial Block Download. **Zero direct test coverage.** Workspace-wide grep confirms zero matches for the symbol in `testing/integration/**/*.rs` — no integration test exercises this path either.

The pruning-proof verifier is the gating mechanism for new nodes joining the network. An adversary peer that sneaks a malformed proof past it can fork a fresh node away from the canonical chain.

**Session 3 deeper finding.** This is *not* a simple unit-test gap. The function `validate_pruning_point_proof` takes a `&PruningPointProof` and `&PruningProofMetadata` and reads from 12+ RocksDB stores (`DbHeadersStore`, `DbGhostdagStore`, `DbReachabilityStore`, `DbRelationsStore`, …). The only way to produce a *valid* `PruningPointProof` is to:

1. Stand up a `TestConsensus` instance.
2. Mine a synthetic DAG of depth ≥ `pruning_depth` (which is a function of `finality_depth`; on the production 10-BPS network this is ≥ hundreds of thousands of blocks).
3. Trigger pruning so `build_pruning_point_proof` produces a proof.
4. Call `validate_pruning_point_proof` on that proof and assert OK.
5. Mutate the proof to hit each of 31 `PruningImportError` variants + 2 `ProofWeakness` variants.

Steps 2-3 are an integration-test scale of work. Existing helpers exist (`TestConsensus::add_header_only_block_with_parents`, `TestBlockBuilder::build_block_template_with_parents`) but no test currently builds a DAG anywhere near pruning depth.

**Recommended action (out of scope for Session 3):**

1. **Session 4 (dedicated)** — research the minimum DAG depth that produces a coherent pruning proof. **Session 3 follow-up:** `pruning_depth` is computed as `finality_depth + 2·merge_depth + 4·mergeset_size_limit·k + 2k + 2` (`consensus/core/src/config/bps.rs:96-107`). With the structural floors enforced by `Bps<BPS>` (`mergeset_size_limit ≥ 180`, `ghostdag_k ≥ 18` for BPS=1), the minimum coherent `pruning_depth` is approximately **13,094 blocks** even on BPS=1 — *not* the "≈ 32" originally floated. A useful integration test therefore needs either:
   - A multi-thousand-block synthetic DAG (slow but viable), or
   - Constants overrides at the workspace level (touching `bps.rs` floors, which has cross-cutting impact and would itself need a regression suite).

2. Once a tractable harness exists, add `consensus/src/processes/pruning_proof/tests.rs` with:
   - `test_validate_pruning_proof_round_trip` — happy path: build a proof on the synthetic DAG, validate it, assert OK.
   - `test_validate_pruning_proof_rejects_*` for each `PruningImportError` variant (31 variants → at least cover the 2 `ProofWeakness` variants first).
3. Coverage should reach ≥80% on `validate.rs` after.

**Pre-mainnet:** P1 gate. **Pre-testnet:** documented gap; testnet will exercise the path under real IBD with hundreds of joining nodes, which is itself a useful (if non-deterministic) test.

A scaffold `#[ignore]`d test has not been added to the codebase to avoid lying-about-coverage; this finding is the authoritative record. Estimate revised to **4-8 hours / dedicated session**, not the originally stated 2-3h.

#### F-7 — `pruning_proof/apply.rs` has 0% test coverage (P1) — ⚠️ PARTIAL FIX

**Severity:** P1 — must fix before mainnet (testnet-tolerable).
**Found:** Session 2, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** ⚠️ **partial fix in Session 5, 2026-05-14**. Added `apply_pruning_proof_accepts_validated_proof` integration test alongside the F-6 round-trip and truncated tests in `testing/integration/src/consensus_integration_tests.rs`, but **marked `#[ignore]`** with a clear TODO documenting the missing piece (see F-18 below).

The proof-and-trusted_set assembly logic is in place and reusable:
- Producer builds 200-block DAG, waits for pruning.
- Calls `producer.get_pruning_point_anticone_and_trusted_data()` to get the anticone hashes + their ghostdag.
- Iterates anticone, calls `producer.get_block(h)` to fetch each block body, finds the matching `TrustedGhostdagData` by hash, assembles `Vec<TrustedBlock>`.

The remaining piece — running `apply_pruning_proof` against a pristine `StagingConsensus` instead of a `TestConsensus` — needs the full `ConsensusFactory` + `ConsensusManager` plumbing (see `staging_consensus_test` at line 1097 of the same file for the recipe). Mechanically straightforward, ~50 lines of additional setup; deferred to a focused follow-up commit.

#### F-18 — `apply_proof` panics via `.unwrap()` on `HashAlreadyExists` when called on a non-pristine DB (P2 — precondition-only)

**Severity:** P2 — precondition documentation gap, not exploitable.
**Found:** Session 5, 2026-05-14, during F-7 test attempt.
**Status:** open.

**Description.** `consensus/src/processes/pruning_proof/apply.rs:172`:
```rust
self.headers_store.insert(header.hash, header.clone(), block_level).unwrap();
```

The `unwrap()` assumes the headers store does not already contain `header.hash`. The proof includes the genesis header at its lowest `BlockLevel` (level 0). In production IBD, `apply_proof` is only called on a `StagingConsensus` whose DB is pristine, so the genesis re-insert silently succeeds. When called on a regular `Consensus` instance (which seeds genesis at construction time), the insert returns `Err(HashAlreadyExists(...))` and the `.unwrap()` panics rather than returning a meaningful error.

**Impact.** Zero on production today — every IBD code path that calls `apply_pruning_proof` goes through `new_staging_consensus()` first (`protocol/flows/src/ibd/flow.rs:160, 469, 500`). The bug is purely a *precondition documentation* gap and a *test surface* friction point — the F-7 integration test cannot exercise the apply path without replicating the staging plumbing.

**Recommended fix (any of, P2 priority):**
1. **Best (defense-in-depth):** in `apply_proof::populate_reachability_and_headers`, change line 172 to tolerate "already present" by mapping the `HashAlreadyExists` error case to a no-op (the existing local `dag` map already gates against duplicate inserts within one call; the persistent-store collision only happens when the validator already had the header, which is the same logical outcome).
2. **Acceptable:** at the top of `apply_proof`, assert `self.headers_store.get(genesis_hash).is_err()` (i.e., pristine DB) and return `Err(PruningImportError::ApplyOnNonPristineDb)` with a clear message. Documents the precondition + makes the failure explicit + non-panicking.
3. **Doc-only:** add a rustdoc on `apply_proof` saying "MUST be called on a StagingConsensus or other pristine DB". Doesn't fix the panic but at least flags it.

(1) is the cleanest. (2) is the most surgical for an audit-driven fix.

#### F-8 — IBD + v7 message handlers have 0% coverage (P1)

**Severity:** P1 — must fix before mainnet (testnet-tolerable with manual smoke).
**Found:** Session 2, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** open.

**Description.** `protocol/flows/src/ibd/{flow,negotiate,progress,streams}.rs` totals 858 lines / 82 fns, all 0%. The v7 family (`v7/{blockrelay,ping,address,request_*,*}`) adds another ~1,200 lines / 130 fns. These are the message handlers that govern how a fresh node syncs from peers. Bugs here typically manifest as IBD stalls or partial syncs — caught by devnet integration testing but not by unit tests.

**Action.** Tier 1 audit (Sessions 6-7) must inventory the v7 / v8 protocol surface, identify which messages have *no* integration test exercising them on devnet, and either add coverage or document the risk.

#### F-9 — CLI binary `main.rs` has 0% coverage (P2)

**Severity:** P2 — post-mainnet technical debt.
**Found:** Session 2, 2026-05-14.

**Description.** Several `*/src/main.rs` are 0% covered (most by-design):
- `dilithium-wallet/src/main.rs` — 1142 lines, 72 fns
- `miner/src/main.rs` — 250 lines, 8 fns
- `testnet-faucet/src/main.rs` — 0%
- `sophis-explorer/src/main.rs` — 0%
- `tools/sophis-*/src/main.rs` — 0%

These are end-user CLI binaries. Integration / smoke tests on devnet implicitly exercise them but no automated assertion holds. Acceptable for testnet; tightening requires either extracting logic into a `lib.rs` testable surface or building a CLI smoke-test harness.

## 3. Tier 1 — Operational security (Sessions 6-7)

### 3.1 `svm/*` — sVM stack audit (Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14)

Audited files: `svm/host/src/lib.rs`, `svm/runtime/src/{validator,host,context}.rs`, `svm/lint/src/*`, `consensus/src/processes/transaction_validator/tx_validation_in_isolation.rs::validate_contract_deploy`.

**Verdict per file:**

| File | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `svm/host/src/lib.rs` | ✅ STRONG | All 4 host crypto methods (`verify_dilithium`, `sha3_384`, `verify_risc0_proof`, `verify_plonky3_proof`) correctly wired. `cfg(not(feature = "risc0"))` and `cfg(not(feature = "plonky3"))` branches explicitly *log + panic* rather than return `false` — prevents silent consensus fork between feature-on and feature-off nodes. Documented rationale in lines 38-58 and 65-82. |
| `svm/runtime/src/validator.rs` | ✅ STRONG | 7 security layers confirmed: float scalar (f32/f64), float SIMD (F32x4/F64x2 NaN payload divergence), atomics/threads, shared-memory imports, unbounded memory, memory > 256 pages (16 MiB), bytecode size limit. Single entry point `validate_bytecode`; 16 unit tests per coverage data. |
| `svm/runtime/src/host.rs` | ✅ STRONG | All 11 host fns gated with `check_capability(&Capability::X)` at function entry, returning a specific error code on missing capability: 0 for read paths, -1 for VRF/Alt/Event, -2 for DA. Coverage: see F-10 below for the residual "return-vs-trap" doc drift. |
| `svm/runtime/src/context.rs` | ✅ STRONG | `check_capability` is a direct delegate to `manifest.has_capability(cap)`; correct.`ExecutionContext::new` defaults backends to safe stubs (`StubDa`, `StubAlt`, `StubVrf`) that are replaced by real backends only when consensus transaction validator wires them. |
| `svm/lint/src/*` | ⚠️ GAP (see F-10) | Only 3 lints: `no_float`, `no_unchecked_arith`, `no_unsafe`. No lint enforces that the contract's `required_capabilities` matches the host fns it imports from `env::*`. |
| `consensus/.../validate_contract_deploy` | ⚠️ GAP (see F-10) | Validates WASM bytecode (calls `validate_bytecode`), `contract_id == hash(wasm)`, and `upgrade_policy.is_valid()`. **Does not** post-validate that the contract's WASM `ImportSection` (from the `"env"` module) is consistent with the manifest's `required_capabilities`. |

#### F-10 — Manifest / WASM-imports consistency not enforced at deploy time (P2)

**Severity:** P2 — defense-in-depth gap, not a unilateral vulnerability.
**Found:** Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** open.

**Description.** A contract declares `required_capabilities` in its `ContractManifest`. The runtime calls `check_capability` at every host-fn entry and returns a specific error code (0 / -1 / -2) if the capability is missing. The runtime does **not** trap, despite CLAUDE.md saying *"Wasmtime traps immediately if the contract calls a host function not listed in its ContractManifest.required_capabilities."* (`C:\Projetos\sophis\CLAUDE.md` original line.) Behavior is correct (graceful error) but diverges from doc.

The deeper concern is that **no layer enforces consistency between the WASM's `(import "env" "verify_dilithium")` (et al.) and the manifest's `required_capabilities` array**:
- `svm/lint/src/*` has rules for floats / unchecked arith / unsafe but not for imports-vs-capabilities.
- `validate_contract_deploy` checks WASM bytecode + contract_id + upgrade_policy but not imports-vs-manifest.
- Runtime `check_capability` is the only line of defense, returning an error code.

**Attack model.** Self-harm only — a contract author who declares `required_capabilities = []` and then writes `let ok = env::verify_dilithium(...); /* ignore */ release_funds(...)` has shot their own foot, but only their own. **No cross-contract / cross-tx attack** is enabled because the runtime check still fires and the host fn still returns 0. There is no privilege escalation.

The real-world risk is third-party contract libraries that internally call `env::*` host fns: if a library is imported into a parent contract that doesn't declare the necessary capability, the parent silently gets a failure return without any deploy-time signal.

**Recommended mitigation (any of, P2 priority):**
1. **Deploy-time check:** in `validate_contract_deploy`, walk the WASM `ImportSection` for `"env"` namespace, map each imported fn to its `Capability` (the registration in `host.rs` is the canonical map), and reject the deploy if any imported host fn maps to a `Capability` not in `manifest.required_capabilities`. Strongest mitigation.
2. **Static lint:** add an `svm-lint` rule that inspects the contract's `#[sophis_contract]` macro expansion and confirms the manifest enumerates every capability used at the source level. Catches it at `cargo dylint` time.
3. **Doc fix only:** update CLAUDE.md to say "returns an error code (graceful) rather than traps". Acceptable as a near-term placeholder, but does not eliminate the silent-failure third-party-library risk.

**Why P2 not P1:** there is no cross-contract attack and no consensus-fork risk. The capability check is enforced; the gap is operator-side / library-side. Acceptable for testnet (which has no production-grade third-party WASM ecosystem yet); should be fixed before mainnet enables a contract-developer flywheel.

### 3.2 `svm/sdk` + `svm/sdk-macros` (Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14)

**Verdict per file:**

| File | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `svm/sdk-macros/src/lib.rs` | ✅ STRONG | `#[sophis_contract]` attribute macro walks the AST and rejects (a) `unsafe fn` on the outer signature, (b) `unsafe` blocks, (c) `unsafe fn` declarations inside, (d) float literals, (e) unchecked arithmetic operators (`+ - * / %`). Generates the `extern "C" fn validate() -> i32` entry point with the user's fn renamed to `__sophis_inner_<name>`. **The macro does *not* generate `ContractManifest::required_capabilities`** — that's separately declared by the deployer in the deploy tx payload. This is the structural origin of F-10. |
| `svm/sdk/src/env.rs` | ⚠️ GAP (see F-11) | Declares 9 of the 11 host functions actually registered by `svm/runtime/src/host.rs`. **Missing from the SDK surface:** `sophis_alt_lookup` (Capability::ResolveAlt) and `sophis_verify_da` (Capability::VerifyDataAvailability). |

#### F-11 — SDK surface incomplete: ALT and DA host fns not exposed (P2)

**Severity:** P2 — ergonomics gap, not a security vulnerability.
**Found:** Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** open.

**Description.** `svm/sdk/src/env.rs` declares the extern "C" shims that contract authors call via `env.verify_dilithium(...)`, `env.sha3_384(...)`, etc. The grep for `sophis_alt_lookup` and `sophis_verify_da` (or `alt_lookup` / `verify_da`) in the file returns **zero matches**, yet both are real host functions registered in `svm/runtime/src/host.rs` and have corresponding `Capability::ResolveAlt` and `Capability::VerifyDataAvailability` variants.

Contracts that need to resolve L1 ALT references (e.g., a multisig contract spending v=1 transactions) or check Phase 6 DA presence (e.g., the rollup withdrawal contract, oracle aggregator) must therefore:
1. Declare their own `extern "C" { fn sophis_alt_lookup(...) -> i32; }` block.
2. Write their own unsafe FFI shim.
3. Wire the call manually.

**Why P2 not P1:** the runtime side is fully functional (host fns work). The capability check still fires (Capability::ResolveAlt / VerifyDataAvailability would still be in the manifest). The only impact is contract-author ergonomics + a higher barrier for third-party contract development.

**Recommended fix.** Add to `svm/sdk/src/env.rs`:
- `pub fn alt_lookup(&self, handle: &[u8; 6], index: u8) -> Option<Vec<u8>>` calling `sophis_alt_lookup`.
- `pub fn verify_da(&self, hash: &[u8; 48], min_confirmations: u32, query_kind: u8) -> Result<DaPresence, DaError>` calling `sophis_verify_da`.

Mirror the existing `verify_dilithium` / `emit_event` shim style. Update `svm/sdk` semantic version to signal new SDK surface to downstream consumers.

### 3.3 `mining` + `miner` (donate flag) — Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14

| File | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `miner/src/donate.rs` | ✅ STRONG | `MAX_DONATION_OUTPUTS = 8` cap; `parse_donations` enforces length match + cap + percent sum ≤ 100 (u32 to safely catch overflow) + prefix match across all entries; `compute_split` uses u128 arithmetic to prevent overflow during `total_value * pct / 100`, `saturating_sub` prevents underflow, rounding remainder always accrues to miner; `rewrite_coinbase_outputs` preserves miner output at index 0 (tooling compatibility); 18 unit tests per coverage map. **Aligned with Operational Boundaries Statement** — no core-team curated NGO list, opt-in client-side. |

### 3.4 `wallet/typed-data` (J2 typed signing) — Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14

| File | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `wallet/typed-data/src/digest.rs` | ✅ STRONG | `TYPED_SIGNING_PREFIX = [0x73, 0x01]` ABI-frozen with explicit test (`prefix_bytes_are_frozen_abi`); `compute_typed_digest = SHA3-384(prefix \|\| domain_separator \|\| struct_hash)` truncated to 32 bytes; deterministic schema lookup. Mirrors EIP-712 structure with Sophis-native primitives. 35 tests per CLAUDE.md. |

### 3.5 RPC stack (auth + bind defaults) — Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14

| File | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `rpc/wrpc/server/src/service.rs` | ✅ STRONG | Default `listen_address: "127.0.0.1:47110"` — localhost-only by default, matches Bitcoin/Ethereum RPC security posture. `MAX_WRPC_MESSAGE_SIZE = 128 MB` caps incoming WS frames. **Minor:** lines 73-80 contain a commented-out `handshake::greeting(...)` block marked `TODO - discuss and implement handshake` — dead-code TODO since the operational posture is "no auth at RPC layer; operator runs reverse proxy with TLS/auth if exposing remotely". Recommend deleting the dead block (not a security issue, just clutter). |
| `sophisd/src/args.rs:171` | ✅ OK | `config.p2p_listen_address = ContextualNetAddress::unspecified()` defaults p2p to all interfaces (0.0.0.0), which is correct — a p2p node must accept incoming peer connections. |

### 3.6 Protocol flows + peer banning (F-8 area) — Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14

| File | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `protocol/flows/src/ibd/flow.rs` | ⚠️ TODO-noisy | The IBD flow correctly disconnects peers on misbehavior at 8+ call sites (`streams.rs:166`, `flow.rs:293/308/418/582/640/725/896`). But line 79 carries the bare TODO *"define a peer banning strategy"* and lines 293, 308, 418 say *"consider performing additional actions on finality conflicts in addition to disconnecting from the peer (e.g., banning, rpc notification)"*. **The mechanism exists** (`components/addressmanager/src/stores/banned_address_store.rs` implements `BannedAddressesStore` with `set/get/remove` keyed by IPv6-mapped address and a `ConnectionBanTimestamp`). What's missing is the *policy* — how a misbehaving peer transitions from "disconnect once" to "added to the ban store". See F-12 below. |
| `components/addressmanager/src/stores/banned_address_store.rs` | ✅ STRONG | Store implementation is clean: IPv4→IPv6-mapped key (16 bytes), per-IP ConnectionBanTimestamp, `set/get/remove` semantics. Ready for callers. |

#### F-12 — Peer banning strategy not defined (P2)

**Severity:** P2 — testnet-tolerable; pre-mainnet hardening recommended.
**Found:** Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** open.

**Description.** The peer-banning *mechanism* is fully implemented. The IBD + p2p flows correctly *disconnect* misbehaving peers at every adversarial decision point. **What's missing** is the *strategy* that promotes "disconnected" to "banned" — i.e., the per-IP score that tracks repeated misbehavior across reconnections and writes to the ban store after a threshold.

Without this strategy, a malicious peer:
1. Connects to a node.
2. Submits invalid IBD message → gets disconnected.
3. Immediately reconnects.
4. Repeats.

Each individual disconnect is correct, but the aggregate behavior is "infinite retries with no cost". CPU/memory cost per disconnect is small, but it's a DoS-amplification surface.

**Recommended mitigation.** Define a peer-score policy at the `protocol/flows` or `protocol/p2p` layer:
- Per-IP score, decay with time, increment on disconnect cause.
- Threshold → write to `BannedAddressesStore` with a ban duration (e.g., 24h initial, exponential backoff on repeat).
- Connection accept hook reads the store before handshake; reject banned IPs.

This is a Bitcoin Core-style policy; the Kaspa upstream may have had a partial implementation that the Sophis fork preserved but did not finish wiring.

### 3.7 `wallet/bip39` (BIP-39 mnemonic) — Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14

| File | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `wallet/bip39/src/mnemonic/seed.rs` | ✅ STRONG | `Seed::SIZE = 64` (BIP-39 spec). Implements `Drop` that calls `zeroize()` — secret material does not linger in freed memory. |
| `wallet/bip39/src/mnemonic/phrase.rs` | ✅ STRONG | `PBKDF2_ROUNDS = 2048` (BIP-39 standard). PBKDF2 driven by `Hmac<Sha512>` (BIP-39 standard). `Mnemonic::random` calls `rand::rng()` (rand 0.9 ThreadRng, `CryptoRng`-trait enforced, getrandom-seeded). 16-byte / 32-byte entropy supported (12-word / 24-word). |

### 3.8 `dilithium-wallet` (CLI binary, F-9 area) — Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14

| File | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `dilithium-wallet/src/main.rs` derivation + crypto helpers | ✅ STRONG | `derive_dilithium_from_mnemonic` zeroizes the 32-byte randomness slice after use (line 104). Calls `Mnemonic::new` for validation. ML-DSA-44 key generation via `libcrux_ml_dsa::ml_dsa_44::generate_key_pair`. Integer arithmetic everywhere in fee / mass calculations (`saturating_sub`, `div_ceil`). |
| `dilithium-wallet/src/main.rs::cmd_keygen` + `wallet.save` | ⚠️ **F-13 (P1)** | Generates and writes **plaintext** JSON wallet file containing `signing_key_hex` and `mnemonic` when invoked with `--network mainnet`. The on-screen warning (lines 290-294) tells the user "guarde estas 24 palavras offline" but does **not** warn that the JSON file also embeds the signing key. See F-13. |

#### F-13 — `dilithium-wallet --network mainnet` writes plaintext signing key to disk (P1) ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** P1 — must fix before mainnet launch.
**Found:** Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** ✅ **fixed in commit `7b5231c` (Session 5, 2026-05-14)**. Added `reject_mainnet_plaintext(network, op)` helper invoked from `cmd_keygen` AND `cmd_restore` BEFORE any cryptographic material is generated or any file is touched. When `network == "mainnet"`, prints a clear error box pointing the operator at `mainnet-mining/WALLET-PROCEDURE.md` (the canonical air-gapped 9-step procedure) and exits with code 2. For testnet/devnet, the on-screen warning was expanded to explicitly call out that the JSON itself contains the signing key in plaintext.

Runtime smoke verified on Windows:
- `dilithium-wallet keygen --network mainnet` → exit 2, **no file created** ✅
- `dilithium-wallet keygen --network testnet` → exit 0, address printed ✅ (with new expanded warning visible)

**Description.** `dilithium-wallet/src/main.rs` is declared at line 1 as "CLI PQC Wallet para Devnet/Testnet Sophis" — devnet/testnet only. But the `--network` CLI argument (line 1088) accepts `["devnet", "testnet", "mainnet"]` with no guard, and `prefix_for("mainnet")` (line 266) returns `Prefix::Mainnet`, fully wiring mainnet support into the CLI.

`cmd_keygen` (line 271) runs `wallet.save(wallet_path)` at line 280, which calls `std::fs::write(path, serde_json::to_string_pretty(self)?)` at line 161 — writes a plaintext JSON with the fields:
- `signing_key_hex` (2560-byte ML-DSA-44 signing key, hex-encoded, plaintext)
- `mnemonic` (24-word BIP-39 phrase, plaintext)
- `verification_key_hex`, `address`, `network`, `version`

There is **no encryption, no passphrase, no file-permission hardening** (umask, chmod 600). The on-screen warning at lines 290-294 advises the user to "Anote offline" — but refers only to the *mnemonic*; it does not warn that the JSON file on disk also contains the raw signing key.

**Risk model.** A user follows the testnet workflow on mainnet:
1. Cloud-synced home dir (OneDrive / Dropbox / iCloud) silently uploads the JSON to a third-party server.
2. Antivirus / EDR vendor's telemetry uploader catalogs the file.
3. The user accidentally `git add .` in their wallet directory.
4. A second compromised process on the same user account reads the file (Discord, browser extension, npm install postinstall, etc.).

Any of these paths leaks the signing key while the user believes they only need to protect the mnemonic.

The CLAUDE.md `mainnet-mining/WALLET-PROCEDURE.md` already documents the canonical mainnet workflow (air-gapped keygen, mnemonic on paper, JSON destroyed). The CLI accepting `--network mainnet` invites users to bypass that procedure.

**Recommended fix (any of, P1 priority):**
1. **Reject `--network mainnet` in `cmd_keygen` outright.** Print a message pointing to `mainnet-mining/WALLET-PROCEDURE.md`. Other commands (balance, send) can keep mainnet support if they don't write a wallet file. Strongest mitigation.
2. **Refuse to write the JSON if `network == "mainnet"`.** Force the user to use stdout-only output + air-gapped paper backup.
3. **Encrypt the wallet file** with a user-provided passphrase: Argon2id KDF (m=64MB, t=3, p=1) → ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD. Acceptable but adds significant code surface.
4. **At minimum, expand the on-screen warning** to explicitly say *"This JSON file contains your private signing key in plaintext. Do not sync it to cloud, do not commit it, do not leave it on a connected machine for mainnet use."*

**Recommendation:** Combine 1 + 4 — reject mainnet keygen + expand the warning for testnet/devnet to mention the JSON-vs-mnemonic distinction.

### 3.9 `wallet/pskt` (cold-storage flow) — Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14

| File | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `wallet/pskt/src/pskt.rs` | ✅ STRONG | Dilithium-only PSBS (D3/D4 spec). 6 BIP-174-style roles: `Creator`, `Updater`, `Signer`, `Combiner`, `Finalizer`, `Extractor`. Suporta multi-signer + air-gapped workflow exatamente como precisa para mainnet. **Mas** dilithium-wallet `cmd_keygen` não roteia mainnet pra esse fluxo por default → fonte de F-13. |

### 3.10 `mining/mempool` — Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14

| File | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `mining/src/mempool/check_transaction_standard.rs` | ✅ STRONG | (a) tx version in `[min, max]` range; (b) compute_mass + transient_mass ≤ 10,000,000 (`MAXIMUM_STANDARD_TRANSACTION_MASS`); (c) sig script ≤ 4,096B (sized for Dilithium-2 P2SH sig = 2,424 + redeem 1,319 = 3,743); (d) v=3,4 (legacy rollup bridge) and v=5 (Phase 6 DA carrier) treated as protocol payloads — skip dust + non-standard-class checks for opaque borsh bodies. Mass cap protects against CPU-exhaustion DoS. |

### 3.11 `sophisd` startup defaults — Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14

| File | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sophisd/src/args.rs` | ✅ STRONG | `unsafe_rpc: bool` defaults to `false` (line 109). Enables state-affecting RPC commands only when `--unsaferpc` flag or `SOPHISD_UNSAFERPC` env var is set. Correct posture: read-only RPC by default, opt-in for mutations. |
| `sophisd/src/args.rs:171` | ✅ OK | `p2p_listen_address = ContextualNetAddress::unspecified()` (0.0.0.0) — correct for a node that must accept inbound peer connections. |

### 3.12 `wallet/{descriptors,filters,spv}` — Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14

| File | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `wallet/descriptors/src/parse.rs` | ✅ STRONG | Checksum validation **before** body parsing (fail-fast on typos). Each error path returns a specific `ParseError` variant. Single-pass recursive-descent parser; no external parser-combinator dependency surface. `VK_HEX_LEN = 2624` (Dilithium-2 VK hex). |
| `wallet/spv/src/header_chain.rs` (J5) | ✅ STRONG | Pure function `validate_header_link(prev, next)`: 3 explicit checks — (a) `next.selected_parent_hash == prev.hash`, (b) `next.blue_score > prev.blue_score` (strict monotonic), (c) `next.daa_score >= prev.daa_score` (non-decreasing, equality allowed for GHOSTDAG mergeset edge cases). PoW verification delegated to caller (correct separation of concerns). Tests in `#[cfg(test)]` mod. |
| `wallet/filters/src/filter.rs` (K2) | ✅ STRONG | BIP-158 *shape* with Sophis-canonical primitives: SHA3-384 (not SipHash-2-4), `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = b"sophis-cf-v1\0"` (ABI-frozen 14-byte separator matching the `sophis-{subsystem}-v1\0` pattern), `GOLOMB_RICE_P = 19` / `M = 524_288` ABI-frozen. `map_to_range` uses the widening-multiply unbiased range mapping `((raw as u128) * range) >> 64` — explicit defense against the modulo-bias pitfall. |

### 3.13 `mining/mempool` config + validation pipeline — Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14

| File | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `mining/src/mempool/config.rs` | ✅ STRONG | All caps bounded: 1M tx count, 1GB mempool size, 500 orphans, 100KB orphan mass, 5 block-template attempts, 1000-sompi/kg min relay fee. `apply_ram_scale` only scales **down** (`ram_scale.min(1.0)`) — operator cannot accidentally inflate limits via runtime flag. Expire intervals tuned per `target_milliseconds_per_block` so the cleanup cadence tracks the BPS rate. |
| `mining/src/mempool/validate_and_insert_transaction.rs` | ✅ STRONG | Two-phase pipeline `pre_validate_and_populate_transaction` + `post_validate_and_insert_transaction` with defense-in-depth duplicate-check + unacceptance re-check before insertion. Missing-outpoint failures routed to orphan pool (bounded by `maximum_orphan_transaction_count`). RBF (replace-by-fee) feerate gate enforced separately. |

### 3.14 `sophisd` daemon startup — Session 3 continuation, 2026-05-14

| File | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sophisd/src/daemon.rs:552-558` | ✅ STRONG | `p2p_server_addr = args.listen.unwrap_or(ContextualNetAddress::unspecified())` — defaults p2p to all interfaces (correct for inbound peer accept). `grpc_server_addr = args.rpclisten.unwrap_or(ContextualNetAddress::loopback())` — **gRPC defaults to 127.0.0.1**, matching the wRPC default at the service layer. No way to accidentally expose RPC remotely without explicit operator action. |
| `sophisd/src/args.rs:62, 115` | ✅ STRONG | `rpc_max_clients: 128` default. `main.rs:42` deducts `rpc_max_clients + inbound_limit + outbound_target` from the process fd budget — file-descriptor accounting is explicit; runaway RPC clients cannot starve consensus or block-relay sockets. |

### 3.15 Tier 1 — overall verdict (Session 3 closure)

**Audit coverage achieved:** 17 critical-perimeter areas. Verdicts: **15 ✅ STRONG + 4 ⚠️ GAP**:

```
✅ svm/host, svm/runtime/{validator, host, context}, svm/sdk-macros
⚠️ svm/sdk env.rs (F-11), svm/lint + validate_contract_deploy (F-10)
✅ mining/{donate, check_transaction_standard, mempool config, validate pipeline}
✅ wallet/{typed-data/digest, bip39/{seed,phrase}, pskt, descriptors, filters, spv}
✅ dilithium-wallet derive + helpers
⚠️ dilithium-wallet cmd_keygen (F-13)
✅ rpc/wrpc bind defaults
✅ sophisd args + daemon startup (loopback RPC, fd budget)
✅ protocol/flows IBD disconnect + banned_address_store
⚠️ protocol/flows banning strategy (F-12)
```

**Tier 1 segments deferred** (not blocking testnet, but worth a pass before mainnet flywheel):
- `mining/manager.rs` + `block_template/` selectors — heavy on combinatorics, well-tested per coverage data; skim verdict pending
- `protocol/flows/v7/*` message handlers in detail (F-8 documents the 0% coverage cluster; the disconnect-on-misbehavior pattern verified above is the load-bearing safety)
- `wallet/pskt/src/{bundle,crypto,input,output,global}.rs` (helpers around the audited `pskt.rs` core)

### 3.13 Anti-long-range-attack confirmed Session 1 §1.6 — no further action.

---

## 3.14 New findings from Session 5 (impeccable-tests pipeline, 2026-05-14)

#### F-14 — Phase 6 adversarial test runner: 3 stale filter paths (test-runner bug) ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** test infrastructure (not production code).
**Found:** Session 5, 2026-05-14, during `python devnet/test_phase6_da_attacks.py` first run.
**Status:** ✅ **fixed in script `G:\Meu Drive\Claude\Sophis\devnet\test_phase6_da_attacks.py` (Session 5, 2026-05-14)**. Script lives in `G:\` (Google Drive), not in the git repo; the fix is on the operator's machine.

**Description.** The adversarial runner invokes `cargo test --lib -p <PKG> <FILTER> -- --exact`. The `--exact` flag requires the filter to match the full test path including all parent modules. Three filters in `THREATS[T5, T9, T11]` omitted the `processes::transaction_validator::` module prefix, so cargo found 0 matching tests and the runner reported `[FAIL] (cargo exit=0, passed=0, failed=0)` for them:

- `tx_validation_in_isolation::tests::carrier_rule_13_too_many_in_single_tx`
- `tx_validation_in_isolation::tests::carrier_happy_path_multiple_within_cap`
- `tx_validation_in_isolation::tests::carrier_parse_error_lifts_to_carrier_malformed`

All three tests **do exist** (manually verified: `processes::transaction_validator::tx_validation_in_isolation::tests::carrier_rule_13_too_many_in_single_tx` ran exit 0 / 1 passed on its own). The defenses behind T5 (per-tx cap rule 13), T9 (rule 13 + malformed parse), and T11 (storage griefing) are intact. **Only the test-runner output was misleading.**

**Fix.** Prepended `processes::transaction_validator::` to the three filter strings. Re-run: **all 13 threats green in 164.3 s**.

#### F-15 — Math fuzz targets don't compile (P1) — ⚠️ PARTIAL FIX

**Severity:** P1 — pre-mainnet (fuzz coverage missing on BlueWork / chain-work arithmetic).
**Found:** Session 5, 2026-05-14, during `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.fuzz`.
**Status:** ⚠️ **partial fix in this session (compile unblock); see F-17 for follow-up**. `math/fuzz/Cargo.toml` was extended with the 11 transitive deps that `construct_uint!` requires (wasm-bindgen, js-sys, serde, serde-wasm-bindgen, borsh, faster-hex, malachite-base, malachite-nz, thiserror, workflow-*, sophis-utils). After the fix the fuzz targets compile and **actually run** — surfacing F-17 below. The proper long-term fix (refactor `construct_uint!` to feature-gate the WASM surface) is recorded as out of scope.

**Description.** `math/fuzz/fuzz_targets/{u128,u192,u256}.rs` each invoke `construct_uint!(UintN, N)` from `sophis-math::uint`. The macro expands to include `#[wasm_bindgen]` annotations and `js_sys::*` references for the WASM target surface. The main `sophis-math` crate has `wasm_bindgen` and `js_sys` as dependencies, but the `math/fuzz` crate's `Cargo.toml` does NOT. Compilation fails:

```
error[E0433]: cannot find module or crate `wasm_bindgen` in this scope
  --> fuzz_targets/u128.rs:10:1
   |
10 | construct_uint!(Uint128, 2);
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ use of unresolved module or unlinked crate `wasm_bindgen`
```

Reproduced for u128, u192, u256.

**Impact.** The 3 math fuzz targets have never run since the WASM bindings landed in `construct_uint!`. BlueWork (`Uint256`) feeds into `min_chain_work` + `max_chain_work_seen` (anti-long-range-attack) and into PoW target checks — a regression there would be silent. **Coverage-guided fuzzing on this arithmetic was effectively zero** for the duration of the regression.

**Recommended fix (any of):**
1. Add `wasm-bindgen` and `js-sys` as `[dev-dependencies]` in `math/fuzz/Cargo.toml` (smallest patch; lets the macro expansion resolve to deps that fuzz target binary will simply not link against on Linux).
2. Feature-gate the `#[wasm_bindgen]` annotations inside `construct_uint!` to a `wasm32-sdk` feature; require the macro caller to opt in.
3. Provide a `construct_uint_minimal!` variant for non-WASM consumers (fuzz, kani-proofs, tests) that omits the WASM annotations.

Recommendation (1) is the smallest change to unblock fuzzing. (2) is the cleanest long-term but requires editing every call site.

#### F-16 — `devnet/rothschild_wallet.json` was a pre-Dilithium-migration secp256k1 keypair (test-data, not code)

**Severity:** test-data drift (not production code).
**Found:** Session 5, 2026-05-14, after `sophis-miner -a <old_rothschild_address>` panicked with `InvalidVersion(0)`.
**Status:** open — guidance only; no code change required.

**Description.** The `devnet/rothschild_wallet.json` file on the audit machine was dated 18/04/2026, **before** the 2026-05-04 PQC pivot and the corresponding rothschild migration to Dilithium-internal signing. The schema was the legacy two-field shape:

```json
{ "private_key": "5508760d...82e6", "address": "sophisdev:qp7t6ent0..." }
```

`private_key` is 32 bytes hex (64 chars) — the size of a secp256k1 private key, not the 2560-byte Dilithium-2 signing key. Result: the address it encodes is a v=0 secp256k1 P2PKH-style address; the current `sophis-miner` parser correctly rejects it as `InvalidVersion(0)`.

The CURRENT rothschild binary's auto-keygen produces the correct Dilithium-format wallet (32-byte ML-DSA-44 randomness seed + Dilithium address starting with `qfur2...`).

**Impact.** Throughput-test plumbing (`devnet/throughput_test.py`) failed on this audit machine because (a) the old wallet was loaded by default, and (b) the script's regex for the new keygen output didn't extract the address cleanly. **No production code is affected** — the miner correctly rejects the legacy address.

**Recommendation:** delete the stale `devnet/rothschild_wallet.json` and let the throughput test regenerate it; also fix `devnet/throughput_test.py`'s output parser to match the current rothschild output line shape (`[INFO ] Generated seed <hex> and address <addr>`). Audit-machine-only; not a code finding.

#### F-17 — Math fuzz harnesses panic on overflow inputs (P1 — fuzz validity) ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** P1 — pre-mainnet (fuzz harness needs fixing before it can actually validate the math lib).
**Found:** Session 5, 2026-05-14, immediately after F-15 partial fix unblocked compilation.
**Status:** ✅ **fixed in Session 5, 2026-05-14**. Three harness files patched:

- `math/fuzz/fuzz_targets/u128.rs` — `assert_op` renamed to `assert_arith`, accepts wrapping closures on both sides. `Add::add` / `Mul::mul` replaced with `|a, b| a.overflowing_add(b).0` (lib) and `u128::wrapping_add` / `u128::wrapping_mul` (native). `+ word` / `* word` switched to `overflowing_add_u64(word).0` / `overflowing_mul_u64(word).0`. Shift restricted to `0..128` (lshift `% 128`, rshift `% 128`).
- `math/fuzz/fuzz_targets/u192.rs` — `assert_op` calls updated to pass `|a, b| a.overflowing_add(b).0` / `|a, b| a.overflowing_mul(b).0` on the lib side; BigUint comparator already used `% modulo` so it never panicked. u64 add/mul switched to `overflowing_add_u64` / `overflowing_mul_u64`.
- `math/fuzz/fuzz_targets/u256.rs` — same pattern; BigUint comparator uses `& mask` (where mask = 2^256 - 1) which also never overflows.

**Validation result:** ✅ **6,566,677 total fuzz iterations across 3 targets in 183 s, ZERO crashes**:

| Target | Iterations | Wall | Crashes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `u128` | 5,358,912 | 61 s | 0 |
| `u192` | 615,092 | 61 s | 0 |
| `u256` | 592,673 | 61 s | 0 |

The math library's wrapping arithmetic, division, remainder, bitwise, and shift behavior is now genuinely validated against ground truth (native `u128.wrapping_*` for the 128-bit case; `num_bigint::BigUint` with explicit modulus/mask for the 192/256-bit cases). BlueWork (`Uint256`) is the central type behind `min_chain_work` and `max_chain_work_seen` (anti-long-range-attack), so this coverage is load-bearing for consensus safety.

**Description.** With F-15's compile-time deps in place, all three math fuzz targets (`u128`, `u192`, `u256`) **compile and execute**. libFuzzer then surfaces crashes on the first input it generates for each target (exit status 77 = crash detected). Each crash produces a deterministic failing test case saved under `artifacts/<target>/crash-*`.

Investigating the harness code (`math/fuzz/fuzz_targets/u128.rs`), the crashes are almost certainly **false positives caused by the harness itself**, not bugs in the production math lib:

```rust
// u128 fuzz target, line 74:
let word = u64::from_le_bytes(try_opt!(consume(&mut data)));
assert_eq!(lib + word, native + (word as u128), "native: {native}, word: {word}");
```

`native + (word as u128)` will panic in debug mode when the addition overflows u128. The library's `Uint128 + word` likely uses `wrapping_add` semantics (the macro `construct_uint!` emits `Add` impls that use `overflowing_add` internally). When fuzz selects an overflowing combination, native panics → libFuzzer reports a crash → assert_eq never fires.

Same overflow concern applies to `Mul::mul` (line 80), `Shl::shl` (line 86 — `native << lshift` panics on `lshift >= 128`), and the `naive_mod_inv` helper (lines 154-172) which uses checked `try_into().unwrap()` on values that may exceed `i128::MAX`.

**Impact.** The fuzz harness has never validated the math library because:
1. Pre-F-15 fix: harness didn't compile at all.
2. Post-F-15 fix: harness compiles but crashes immediately on overflow, never reaching the actual library assertions.

The production math library itself is well-tested by the workspace test suite (1,928 unit + integration tests pass on both Tier 1 Windows and Tier 2 Linux Docker, including extensive `math/src/uint.rs` tests). The fuzz coverage on top of that has effectively been zero.

**Recommended fix.** Rewrite each harness assertion to skip overflow inputs OR to compare wrapping-arithmetic on both sides:
```rust
// Before:
assert_eq!(lib + word, native + (word as u128), ...);
// After (skip overflow):
if let Some(native_sum) = native.checked_add(word as u128) {
    assert_eq!(lib + word, native_sum, ...);
}
// OR (compare wrapping):
assert_eq!(lib + word, native.wrapping_add(word as u128), ...);
```

Choose the variant that matches the library's actual semantics. Same pattern for Mul, Shl, mod_inv helper.

**Why P1 not P0:** the production math library is exercised by 34 unit tests in `math/src/uint.rs` and indirectly by every BlueWork comparison in consensus. The fuzz coverage gap is a *defense-in-depth* gap, not an exploit vector. The library's correctness is currently established by the unit-test suite + Kani proofs on Gas saturating arithmetic (which uses the same construct_uint primitives).

### 3.8 Anti-long-range-attack confirmed Session 1 §1.6 — no further action.

## 4. Tier 2 — ZK plumbing (Sessions 8-9) — completed 2026-05-14

Built a Linux Docker image (`docker/Dockerfile.audit`, mirrors `Dockerfile.sophisd`'s builder stage exactly: rust:1.94-bookworm + cmake + clang + libclang-dev + protobuf-compiler + libssl-dev + risc0 toolchain via `rzup install rust && rzup install cpp`). Image size 47 GB. `cargo test --workspace --features svm-zk --no-fail-fast` ran inside the container in **~19.5 min** (1,169 s).

### Result

| Metric | Tier 1 (Windows, exclude risc0 hosts) | Tier 2 (Linux Docker, `--features svm-zk`) |
|---|---|---|
| Test result blocks (suites) | 174 | **177** (+3) |
| Total passed | 1,914 | **1,928** (+14) |
| Total failed | 0 | **0** |
| Total ignored | 65 | **66** (+1) |

The +14 tests / +3 suites in Tier 2 are the risc0-host paths that Windows MSVC could not compile:

- `sophis-rollup-host` library + `rollup/host/guest/` — Phase 3 ZK-Rollup state-update verifier (Risc0 STARK).
- `sophis-svm-host --features risc0` — verifier dispatch for `Capability::VerifyRisc0Proof`.
- Phase 5 oracle paths (`oracle/host` + `oracle/relayer` with `plonky3` feature enabled together with `svm-zk`).
- Phase 6 DA self-DA paths (already tested on Tier 1; here we also catch the `verify_data_availability` host fn dispatch via `svm-zk`).
- Phase 9 PQC oracle (`oracle/pqc-*` crates), all already Tier 1 but the integration with svm-zk is exercised here.

### 4.1 Phase 3 rollup ✅ STRONG

All `sophis-rollup-*` crate tests pass. The Risc0 STARK verifier path (`svm/host/src/risc0.rs::verify_risc0_proof_bytes`) is exercised through the test suite. No code findings.

### 4.2 Phase 5 oracle (DEPRECATED) ✅ NO REGRESSION

Phase 5 ZK-Oracle (legacy `ed25519` STARK trust chain) is marked deprecated 2026-05-11 in `Cargo.toml`. The four remaining crates (`oracle/{core,feeds,host,relayer}`) still compile and pass tests so indexers that depend on the dual-path migration can continue to verify until the SIP-11 D11.flip gate triggers removal. **Verdict:** removal-on-schedule per SIP-11; no audit action.

### 4.3 Phase 6 DA ✅ STRONG

`consensus/core/src/da/` (codec + types) audited at Tier 0 (constants ABI-frozen, tests in place). `consensus/src/model/stores/da.rs` (RocksDB store) exercised in Tier 2 here via the full test suite. `Capability::VerifyDataAvailability` dispatch confirmed wired in `svm/runtime/src/host.rs` (Tier 1 §3.1). No code findings.

### 4.4 Phase 9 PQC oracle ✅ STRONG

### 4.5 Phase 6 adversarial test matrix — Session 5 (impeccable tests pipeline, 2026-05-14)

Ran `devnet/test_phase6_da_attacks.py` (sub-fase 6.7 adversarial runner mapping the 13 threats from `oracle/docs/PHASE6_DA_DESIGN.md` §9 to cargo test filters).

**Result (after F-14 fix):** ✅ **PASS in 164.3 s** — 100% of expected rejections fire, zero spurious accepts, zero panics.

- 8 covered threats (T1, T2, T5, T7, T9, T10, T11, T13) — all cargo test filters green
- 2 skipped threats (T6 censorship, T8 reorgs) — multi-node Byzantine simulation out of unit-test scope
- 3 doc-only threats (T3 hash collision, T4 quantum preimage, T12 CRQC vs ML-DSA-44) — captured by cryptographic-assumption choice (SHA3-384, ML-DSA)

**Initial run found 3 stale test-filter paths** — see F-14 below.

### 4.6 Kani formal verification — Session 5 (impeccable tests pipeline, 2026-05-14)

Built `docker/Dockerfile.kani` (rust:1.94-bookworm + `cargo install --locked kani-verifier` + `cargo kani setup`). Ran `cargo kani --package sophis-kani-proofs` inside Linux container.

**Result:** ✅ **19 / 19 harnesses verified** (Manual Harness Summary: "Complete - 19 successfully verified harnesses, 0 failures, 19 total"). CBMC 6.8.0 / CaDiCaL 2.0.0 backend.

Proofs cover:
- `Gas::saturating_add` totality + monotonicity (no panic, result ≥ each operand)
- `GasConfig::storage_deposit` totality (≥ `STORAGE_BASE_DEPOSIT` for all `datum_bytes`)
- `GasConfig::default()` invariants (positive costs, `risc0 > dilithium`, `plonky3 > dilithium`, `risc0 > plonky3`)
- `Capability::VerifyRisc0Proof` distinct from all other variants
- `Capability::VerifyPlonky3Proof` distinct from all other variants
- `UpgradePolicy::Immutable` always valid
- `UpgradePolicy::OwnerTimelock` valid iff `min_blocks ≥ UPGRADE_MIN_BLOCKS`
- `UpgradePolicy::MultisigTimelock` validity edge cases (empty keys, zero threshold, threshold > keys.len(), boundary)
- Boundary at `UPGRADE_MIN_BLOCKS - 1` (invalid) vs `UPGRADE_MIN_BLOCKS` (valid)

The `any_capability()` symbolic enumerator was updated to cover all **11** Capability variants (commit `ed88a4d`) so future uniqueness-style proofs exhaust the variant space.

### 4.7 Math fuzz — Session 5

**Result:** ❌ **F-15 discovered** — see findings below.

`math/fuzz/fuzz_targets/{u128,u192,u256}.rs` call `construct_uint!` macro from `sophis-math::uint`, which expands to references of `wasm_bindgen` and `js_sys` — neither of which is in `math/fuzz/Cargo.toml`. Three fuzz targets fail at compile time with `error[E0433]: cannot find module or crate 'wasm_bindgen'`. The targets have never actually exercised the BlueWork / chain-work arithmetic since the WASM bindings were added to `construct_uint`.

`docker/Dockerfile.fuzz` was authored to run `cargo +nightly fuzz run u{128,192,256} -- -max_total_time=60` and is preserved for re-use after the fix; it reproduces the compile error inside the container so the failure is captured deterministically.

`oracle/pqc-{core,contract,publisher,tests}` all pass. `pqc-core/src/sign.rs::sign_journal` + `verify_signed_bundle` exercise Dilithium ML-DSA-44 directly (no STARK trust chain — replaces Phase 5 ed25519). The integration scenarios in `oracle/pqc-tests/src/scenarios.rs` (13 tests per coverage data) cover the publisher → relayer → aggregator pipeline end-to-end. **Verdict:** the PQC-native oracle that replaces Phase 5 (per SIP-11) is production-ready.

## 5. Tier 3 — UX/infra (Session 10)

> ⏳ Pending.

### 5.1 Cross-cutting sweep
- `cargo clippy` under each feature combination
- Fuzz target inventory (`math/fuzz`, `crypto/muhash/fuzz`)
- Kani harness coverage (`svm/kani-proofs`)
- `unsafe` block-by-block audit

---

## 5. Tier 3 — UX/infra (preliminary, Session 3 closure)

Spot-checked components — full Tier 3 sweep deferred to a separate session if needed.

| Component | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `testnet-faucet` | ✅ STRONG — per-address cooldown rate limit (config-driven, line 168), CORS `Any` (correct posture for public testnet faucet), bind address configurable. Deployed at `https://faucet.sophis.org/` per project memory. |
| `sophis-explorer`, `sophis-dnsseeder`, `tools/{dashboard,calculator,da-stress}` | ⏳ deferred to a Tier 3 sweep session — none are consensus-critical or operational-security-critical; they consume RPC and present read-only views. Low audit priority pre-testnet. |
| `indexes/{core,processor,utxoindex}`, `notify/`, `metrics/` | ⏳ deferred — internal indexing & observability; tested via the integration test suite (Session 1 baseline showed 1,917 pass including index/notify/metrics tests). |

## 6. Verdict (final, after Tier 2 Linux Docker — 2026-05-14)

This audit was launched on 2026-05-14 in response to the founder's pre-testnet request: *"auditoria completa fase por fase, função por função, parâmetro por parâmetro"*. Sessions 1-3 + extensions covered:

- ✅ **Workspace baseline gates — all GREEN** (compile, test, clippy, devnet end-to-end 10/10).
- ✅ **Tier 0** — consensus-critical surfaces audited (9 invariants confirmed clean + sign_input_dilithium covered with 3 unit tests).
- ✅ **Tier 1** — operational security perimeter audited across 17 areas (15 STRONG + 4 GAP).
- ✅ **Tier 2** — ZK plumbing (Phase 3 rollup + Phase 5 oracle + Phase 6 DA + Phase 9 PQC oracle) audited inside Linux Docker (`docker/Dockerfile.audit`, 47 GB image). `cargo test --workspace --features svm-zk` → **1,928 passed / 0 failed / 66 ignored** across 177 suites. No new findings; Phase 3/6/9 STRONG, Phase 5 ✅ NO REGRESSION (deprecated, removal-on-schedule per SIP-11).
- ✅ **Tier 3** — spot-check on faucet (STRONG); rest deferred (low priority pre-testnet).

**Pre-mainnet blockers (4 P1):** F-6, F-7, F-8, F-13.
**Post-mainnet tech debt (6 items):** F-2 (partial — full type-id check deferred), F-9, F-10, F-11, F-12, plus F-6/F-7/F-13's deeper hardening.

### Verdict: **testnet ✅ APPROVED, with gates**

The workspace meets the baseline bar for testnet launch:

- All compile + test + clippy + devnet gates green.
- Tier 0 consensus invariants confirmed.
- Tier 1 operational security has no exploitable findings; F-13 is testnet-tolerable (testnet wallets are throwaway) and F-10/F-11/F-12 are defense-in-depth gaps that testnet will exercise.

**Mandatory before testnet launch (must do):**
1. **Re-run baseline** at the HEAD that will be tagged for testnet — see `audit/AUDIT_REPORT.md` §1.5 for the four commands.
2. **Tier 2 audit on Linux Docker** — ✅ **done 2026-05-14**. 1,928 passed / 0 failed / 66 ignored. See §4.
3. **Operator-facing warning** that testnet uses a single canonical wallet workflow (dilithium-wallet --network testnet); mainnet must use `mainnet-mining/WALLET-PROCEDURE.md` (per F-13).

**Mandatory before mainnet launch (must close):**
1. **F-13 mitigation** — add the warn-or-reject behavior to `cmd_keygen --network mainnet`.
2. **F-6 + F-7** — stand up a tractable pruning-proof integration harness and produce at least the round-trip positive vector + each `ProofWeakness` variant.
3. **F-8** — review and cover (or document the inherent integration-test-only nature of) the IBD + v7 flow handlers.
4. **F-12** — define + wire the peer banning strategy (Bitcoin-Core-style per-IP score → ban store).

**Recommended (P2, post-mainnet flywheel-permitting):** F-10, F-11, F-9.
