# Sophis — Pre-Testnet Audit Report

**Started:** 2026-05-14
**Auditor:** Claude Code (Opus 4.7, 1M context)
**Scope:** Complete workspace audit before official testnet launch
**Format:** Monolithic report (per founder decision 2026-05-14)
**Cadence:** Multi-session (1-2 weeks)

> **Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS — Session 1 (baseline + inventory)

---

## 0. Methodology

This audit categorizes the workspace into four Tiers by blast radius. A bug in Tier 0 corrupts consensus and is permanently fatal; a bug in Tier 3 is cosmetic. The audit treats them with proportional rigor:

- **Tier 0 — Consensus-critical.** Function-by-function, parameter-by-parameter, every public API and every invariant. Goal: 100% test coverage on consensus paths, every error variant exercised, every constant proven derivation-correct, every panic path justified.
- **Tier 1 — Operational security.** sVM host capabilities, wallet/signing, RPC auth, mining manager, anti-long-range-attack. Each capability covered with positive + adversarial test. Each panic path traced. Each unsafe block justified.
- **Tier 2 — ZK plumbing.** Phase 3 rollup + Phase 5 oracle (deprecated) + Phase 6 DA + Phase 9 PQC oracle. Witness/AIR correctness already covered by RFC/FIPS vectors; audit focuses on wire format invariants, prover/verifier mismatches, dispatch fan-out.
- **Tier 3 — UX/infra.** Faucet, explorer, dashboard, calculator, da-stress, dnsseeder. Smoke tests + obvious safety; not blocking.

Each session below either appends new findings or updates the Veredito section. Findings are classed:
- **P0** — must fix before testnet launch
- **P1** — must fix before mainnet launch
- **P2** — post-mainnet technical debt
- **OK** — confirmed correct under audit, no action needed

## 1. Baseline (Session 1, 2026-05-14)

### 1.1 Repo state

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository | `C:\Projetos\sophis\` |
| Branch | `main` |
| HEAD | `a83bf79` (docs: CLAUDE.md — expand prod infra section) |
| Untracked | `Whitepaper.pdf` (1 file) |
| Working tree | otherwise clean |
| Rust | 1.94.1 (rustc 1.94.1, cargo 1.94.1) |
| Toolchain reqs | LLVM 22+, MSVC Build Tools 2022, protoc, CMake 4.3+ |
| Workspace edition | 2024 |
| Workspace version | `1.1.0` |
| License | Apache-2.0 |

> ⚠️ **Drift vs. project CLAUDE.md:** project CLAUDE.md references `1eead7b` as HEAD ("ROADMAP COMPLETE"). Actual HEAD = `a83bf79`, a docs-only commit *after* the roadmap closer. The roadmap commit `1eead7b` is preserved in history. This is not a regression — it is documentation drift to be re-synced before audit closure.

### 1.2 Workspace inventory

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| Workspace members (Cargo.toml) | **75 crates** + 1 guest workspace (`rollup/host/guest`) |
| Rust source files (excluding `target/`) | **986** |
| Lines of Rust code (excluding `target/`) | **178,745** |
| Test attributes (`#[test]`, `#[tokio::test]`, `#[wasm_bindgen_test]`) | **1,897 in 282 files** |
| `unsafe` blocks/fns/impls | **54 occurrences in 27 files** ⚠️ (must justify each) |
| `pub fn`/`pub async fn`/`pub const fn` (line-start regex; impl-block pubs not counted) | **638 in 233 files** (lower bound) |

> ℹ️ Project CLAUDE.md mentions "414/414 verdes + 4 ignored slow" for Phase 5 oracle scope only. Workspace-wide totals collected here are larger and include integration, sVM, consensus, RPC, wallet, mining, etc.

### 1.5 Baseline test/compile results

| Step | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Compile workspace (Windows, all defaults) | `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` | ❌ **FAILS — known risc0/MSVC issue, expected (§1.5.1)** |
| Compile workspace (Windows, excluding risc0 host crates) | `cargo check --workspace --all-targets --exclude sophis-rollup-host --exclude rollup-node` | ✅ **exit 0 in 1m00s, 99 crates, zero warnings** |
| Workspace test suite | `cargo test --workspace --exclude sophis-rollup-host --exclude rollup-node --no-fail-fast` | ✅ **exit 0** — **174 suites, 1,914 passed, 0 failed, 65 ignored** (Session 1) — after F-5 fix: 1,917/0/65 with 3 new sign tests |
| Clippy CI invariant | `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --exclude sophis-rollup-host --exclude rollup-node -- -D warnings` | ✅ **exit 0** — **0 errors, 0 warnings, finished in 49.53s** (Session 3, after fixing one regression introduced by F-5 commit; see `3261134` "drop useless `ZERO_HASH.into()`") |
| Test suite (svm-zk / risc0) | `cargo nextest run -p sophis-svm-host --features risc0` | ⏳ Linux Docker only — Session 8/9 |
| Test suite (plonky3 dispatch) | `cargo nextest run -p sophis-svm-host --features plonky3` | ⏳ Session 2 (after coverage) |
| Devnet end-to-end (5 nodes) | `python devnet/test_runner.py --fast-mode` | ✅ **10/10 tests passed, 0 failures** (Session 3, end-to-end Phase 1 Rodada 2) — B1.1 devnet bring-up, B1.2 RandomX mining (~0.30 MH/s), B1.3 Dilithium TX throughput, B2.1 keygen, B2.2 coinbase to Dilithium addr, **B2.3 valid TX accepted, B2.4 tampered TX rejected** (verifier-side integrity check), B3.1 stress with 2 simultaneous wallets, B4.1 genesis hash unit, B4.2 Dilithium sign+verify unit |

**Baseline summary:** 100% test pass rate (1,914/1,914 non-ignored). 65 ignored are documented slow paths (RFC 8032 STARK round-trip and similar, per CLAUDE.md §"Status testes"). Note: this count is *higher* than the 1,897 `#[test]` attribute count from §1.2 because doc-tests and macro-generated test cases also contribute.

#### 1.5.1 Known build limitation on Windows (NOT a regression)

`cargo check --workspace` fails on Windows because of two `risc0-sys`-derived C++ build issues:

```
error: failed to run custom build command for `risc0-circuit-keccak-sys v4.0.2`
  cc-rs: cl.exe exit code 2 (C++ compilation failure under MSVC 14.44)
error: failed to run custom build command for `risc0-circuit-recursion-sys v4.0.2`
error: linking with `link.exe` failed: exit code: 1120
  librisc0_zkvm_platform-...: error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol sys_alloc_aligned
```

This is documented in project CLAUDE.md (`§"Caminho 2 — feature-gate svm-zk"`) and ZKBridge memory file:
> "Construção | Linux Docker (canonical); MSVC trava em risc0 C++20 (bug pré-existente, idêntico Sophis)"

**Impact on audit:** Tier 2 audit of `rollup/host` + `rollup/host/guest` + `--features svm-zk` paths must be done in Linux Docker, not on this Windows machine. This is recorded as a baseline limitation, **not** a finding.

**Next-session task:** stand up Linux Docker build (`docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml run …` or equivalent) and re-run `cargo nextest run --workspace --features svm-zk` to populate the Tier 2 baseline.

### 1.6 Invariants confirmed clean on visual inspection

Performed automated grep over the entire workspace; results triaged manually.

| Invariant (per CLAUDE.md) | Grep / Probe | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Devfund on-chain eliminado | `devfund\|dev_fund\|DEV_FUND\|DevFund` | ✅ **CLEAN.** Single match: a comment in `consensus/src/processes/coinbase.rs:110` documenting removal. No code paths reachable. Also verified: zero hits in `consensus/core/src/config/params.rs` (`MAINNET_PARAMS`, `TESTNET_PARAMS`, `SIMNET_PARAMS`, `DEVNET_PARAMS` all clean). |
| Coinbase 100% to miner | Read `consensus/src/processes/coinbase.rs:97-144` | ✅ **CLEAN.** `expected_coinbase_transaction` pays `reward_data.subsidy + reward_data.total_fees` to each mergeset_blue block's reported script; red rewards pay to current `miner_data.script_public_key`. No split, no devfund recipient. |
| Sem privacidade nativa (FHE / OP_PRIVACY / ring sigs / mixers / confidential) | `fhe\|tfhe\|ring_sig\|mixer\|OP_PRIVACY\|confidential` (case-insensitive) | ✅ **CLEAN.** 4 false positives, all matching substring "fhe" inside `ProofHeader` / `JtfHeader` identifiers (case-insensitive). No FHE code remains. |
| Sem Schnorr / secp256k1 (signatures) | `schnorr\|secp256k1` (case-insensitive) | ✅ **CLEAN.** Zero hits in `.rs` files. Note: project CLAUDE.md observes that `rothschild/Cargo.toml` historically listed `secp256k1` as a dep for keypair derivation residual — not verified this session, will check Tier 1. |
| Sem kHeavyHash (PoW = RandomX only) | `kHeavyHash\|KHeavyHash` (case-insensitive) | ⚠️ **PARTIAL.** See finding F-1 below — `KHeavyHash` still compiled as default-OFF feature fallback. |
| sVM `Capability` enum — Dilithium only signature, no Schnorr | Read `svm/core/src/capability.rs` | ✅ **CLEAN.** 11 variants: `ReadUtxo`, `ProduceOutput`, `VerifyDilithium`, `ReadBlockHeight`, `HashSha3`, `VerifyRisc0Proof`, `VerifyPlonky3Proof`, `VerifyDataAvailability`, `ResolveAlt`, `EmitEvent`, `VrfRandomness`. **No `VerifySchnorr`**. CLAUDE.md lists 8 — drift: 3 variants (`ResolveAlt`, `EmitEvent`, `VrfRandomness`) were added via roadmap items #1/#3/#4 in 2026-05-10 but the doc wasn't updated to enumerate them. Code matches the SIPs (SIP-1 ALT, SIP-3 VRF, SIP-4 Events). |
| ABI-frozen constants — L1 ALT | Read `consensus/core/src/alt/mod.rs:70-102, 752-757` | ✅ **CLEAN.** All 8 constants match CLAUDE.md exactly: `ALT_HEADER_LEN=22`, `ALT_HANDLE_LEN=6`, `MAX_ALT_ENTRIES=256`, `MAX_ALT_ENTRY_SCRIPT_BYTES=4096`, `MAX_ALT_CREATIONS_PER_TX=4`, `MAX_ALT_CREATIONS_PER_BLOCK=16`, `BASE_ALT_CREATION_MASS=100_000`, `ALT_STORAGE_MASS_FACTOR=1`. **Tested with `#[test] fn frozen_constants()` at line 752.** |
| ABI-frozen constants — J4 Events | Read `consensus/core/src/events/mod.rs:45-217` | ✅ **CLEAN.** All match CLAUDE.md: `MAX_TOPICS_PER_EVENT=4`, `TOPIC_LEN=32`, `MAX_EVENT_DATA_BYTES=4096`, `MAX_EVENTS_PER_TX=32`, `MAX_EVENTS_PER_BLOCK=1024`, `MAX_LOGS_PER_RESPONSE=1000`, `EVENTS_BY_CONTRACT_BUCKET_SIZE=65_536`. **Tested with `#[test] fn frozen_constants()` at line 207.** |
| Anti-long-range-attack — two-layer architecture | Files touching `min_chain_work` + `max_chain_work_seen` | ✅ **CLEAN.** Both layers wired: (1) `Params.min_chain_work` constant per network — set to `BlueWorkType::ZERO` for all 4 networks at this initial release (per CLAUDE.md "bumpa release-by-release"); (2) `MaxChainWorkSeen` store in `consensus/src/model/stores/max_chain_work_seen.rs` (prefix 62 in `database/src/registry.rs`). Hot paths: `consensus/src/pipeline/header_processor/processor.rs` (gating), `consensus/src/pipeline/virtual_processor/processor.rs` (floor raise). Tests in `consensus/src/pipeline/virtual_processor/tests.rs`. |
| MAX_SCRIPT_PUBLIC_KEY_VERSION expected = 5 (post Phase 6 carrier bump) | grep `MAX_SCRIPT_PUBLIC_KEY_VERSION` | ⏳ to be confirmed Tier 0 / Phase 6 audit. Project CLAUDE.md older line still says =2; memory `project_phase6_subfase_6_1_v5_carrier.md` says bumped to 5 (with v=3,4 reserved). Drift in doc. |

### 1.7 Findings — Session 1 (preliminary)

#### F-1 — PoW algorithm is a compile-time feature flag, not a consensus rule (P1) ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** P1 — must fix before mainnet launch.
**Found:** Session 1, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** ✅ **fixed in commit `a50706f` (same session, 2026-05-14)**. Adopted Option 1 with a WASM exemption: `compile_error!()` at the top of `consensus/pow/src/lib.rs` gated on `#[cfg(all(not(feature = "randomx"), not(feature = "wasm32-sdk")))]`. Verified:
- `cargo check -p sophis-pow` (default features) → exit 0, compiles in ~57s.
- `cargo check -p sophis-pow --no-default-features` → **fails as expected** with the documented message ("sophis-pow requires either the 'randomx' feature … or the 'wasm32-sdk' feature").
- The WASM browser-display path (`wasm.rs`) is preserved.
- Pre-existing latent warning `unused import: std::sync::Arc` in `lib.rs` only surfaces under the now-blocked path; not user-facing.

**Description.**
`sophis-pow` declares `default = ["randomx"]` and gates the entire RandomX integration behind `#[cfg(feature = "randomx")]`. When the feature is OFF, `State::new`, `State::calculate_pow`, and `State::check_pow` fall back to the legacy `Matrix::heavy_hash` + `PowHash` pipeline (`consensus/pow/src/lib.rs:90-95, 132-139, 210-215`; `consensus/pow/src/matrix.rs:124`).

The downstream crates that depend on `sophis-pow` all explicitly request `features = ["randomx"]` in their `Cargo.toml`:
- `consensus/Cargo.toml:32`
- `miner/Cargo.toml:22`
- `bridge/Cargo.toml:16`
- `testing/integration/Cargo.toml:31`

So **the default `cargo build` of a node binary unambiguously uses RandomX**, and any node operator following the documented build instructions is safe.

**Risk.**
A consumer who builds with `--no-default-features` (e.g., to strip an unrelated default feature without realizing this one is load-bearing) or who depends on `sophis-pow` from an out-of-tree wallet/SDK without explicitly setting `features = ["randomx"]` will get a node that validates PoW using `kHeavyHash`. Such a node would reject every real network block (RandomX hash never satisfies a `kHeavyHash`-derived target) — this is a *fail-stop* outcome, not a silent fork. But it would manifest as confusing "all blocks invalid" errors during testnet launch and could erode trust.

**Recommended fixes (any one of):**
1. **Compile-time guard** in `sophis-pow/src/lib.rs`: add a `#[cfg(not(feature = "randomx"))] compile_error!("Sophis requires the 'randomx' feature; non-default builds are not supported on mainnet/testnet")`. Drops the feature from "optional" to "required without an explicit override token."
2. **Runtime assertion** in `sophisd` startup: log + panic if the binary was built without the `randomx` feature. Acceptable but weaker than (1).
3. **Drop the WASM kHeavyHash fallback** in `consensus/pow/src/wasm.rs` — it is explicitly documented as for browser-only dev/educational use and is not exercised by the production node. Move the WASM PoW story to "browsers must use Stratum to a real miner" without shipping any code that pretends otherwise.

**Audit note:** the existence of this code path *probably* dates back to the Kaspa fork and was never deleted when RandomX was wired in. This is dead-code-by-config rather than a vulnerability, but mainnet should not ship with two compilable PoW algorithms in one binary's source tree.

#### F-2 — Unsafe WASM ABI cast lacks safecast check (P2) ✅ FIXED (partial)

**Severity:** P2 — dívida pós-mainnet (WASM-only path; not exercised by mainnet node).
**Found:** Session 1, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** ✅ **null-pointer reject added in commit `cd53691` (Session 3, 2026-05-14).** Full type-id check intentionally deferred — wasm-bindgen does not expose `try_from_abi` for arbitrary user types; emulating the type-id check would require reimplementing wasm-bindgen's internal reference-table bookkeeping. The null-pointer guard closes the most likely accidental-use-after-free trigger (caller passes a moved-from or un-initialized JS handle). A SAFETY comment documents the residual contract.

**Verification:** `cargo check -p sophis-addresses` exit 0 after fix. Wasm32 builds will exercise the new path; native node/miner/RPC unaffected.

#### F-3 — `sVM Capability` enum has 3 variants not enumerated in project CLAUDE.md (documentation drift only — no code finding) ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** doc-drift (not a code finding).
**Found:** Session 1, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** ✅ **fixed in Session 3, 2026-05-14** — `G:\Meu Drive\Claude\Sophis\CLAUDE.md` updated to list all 11 variants (including `ResolveAlt`, `EmitEvent`, `VrfRandomness`) with their roadmap-item references and the canonical source path `svm/core/src/capability.rs`. The repo `C:\Projetos\sophis\CLAUDE.md` was already correct (line 264).

#### F-4 — `MAX_SCRIPT_PUBLIC_KEY_VERSION` documentation drift (Phase 6 carrier bump) ✅ VERIFIED

**Severity:** doc-drift.
**Found:** Session 1, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** ✅ **verified in code (Session 3).** Action item: update CLAUDE.md at audit closure.

**Code reality (verified by direct grep):**
- `consensus/core/src/constants.rs:30` defines `pub const MAX_SCRIPT_PUBLIC_KEY_VERSION: u16 = 5` (this is the L1 consensus value — what `ScriptPublicKey.version` is allowed to be on-chain).
- `crypto/txscript/src/lib.rs:59` defines a *separate* `pub const MAX_SCRIPT_PUBLIC_KEY_VERSION: u16 = 0` (this is the version the txscript *engine* knows how to execute; higher versions get the "anyone-can-spend" treatment until activated, à la Bitcoin segwit reserved versions).
- The two constants are documented as intentionally distinct in `crypto/txscript/src/lib.rs:45-59`: *"**Not** the same as `sophis_consensus_core::constants::MAX_SCRIPT_PUBLIC_KEY_VERSION`"*.

**Conclusion:** Code is correct. CLAUDE.md text — *"MAX_SCRIPT_PUBLIC_KEY_VERSION | 2 (puro — sem versions de bridge externa)"* — is **stale on two counts**:
1. The numeric value is **5**, not 2 (bumped in Phase 6 sub-fase 6.1, with v=3,4 reserved for legacy rollup-bridge versions per project memory `project_phase6_subfase_6_1_v5_carrier.md`).
2. The "puro — sem versions de bridge externa" comment dates back to before Phase 6's V5 DA carrier landed and is no longer accurate.

**Recommended fix** (at audit closure): update the `§"Parâmetros da rede"` table in CLAUDE.md.

**Status:** ✅ **fixed in Session 3, 2026-05-14** — `G:\Meu Drive\Claude\Sophis\CLAUDE.md` line 125 updated with the corrected value (`5`), v=1..5 semantics, and a footnote clarifying that the txscript engine pins its own `MAX_SCRIPT_PUBLIC_KEY_VERSION = 0` intentionally. The repo `C:\Projetos\sophis\CLAUDE.md` does not contain the stale line.

## 1.8 Session 1 — closing summary

**Status:** Session 1 of 7 — **structural baseline complete**, test-suite verification pending.

### What's done

- Workspace inventoried (75 crates, 986 files, 178,745 LOC, 1,897 test attributes, 54 unsafe).
- `audit/AUDIT_REPORT.md` created with full Tier 0/1/2/3 structure for Sessions 2-final.
- 7 audit tasks created in the task list.
- `cargo check --workspace --exclude sophis-rollup-host --exclude rollup-node` → ✅ **exit 0 in 1m00s, 99 crates clean, zero warnings**. Windows MSVC risc0 limitation documented (canonical build = Linux Docker, per project memory).
- **9 invariants visually confirmed clean** (devfund eliminated, coinbase 100% miner, no FHE/privacy, no Schnorr/secp256k1 in code, sVM Capability has no `VerifySchnorr`, L1 ALT constants frozen + tested, J4 Events constants frozen + tested, anti-long-range-attack two layers wired, `min_chain_work = ZERO` per network as documented).
- **4 findings filed**: F-1 (P1 PoW compile-time switch), F-2 (P2 WASM ABI), F-3/F-4 (doc drift).

### What's still running

- `cargo test --workspace --exclude sophis-rollup-host --exclude rollup-node --no-fail-fast` (background; was still compiling test binaries at end of Session 1).
  - When complete, this will populate the actual pass/fail count vs the 1,897 attribute target.
  - Tier 2 svm-zk / risc0 tests must be re-run on Linux Docker — separate session.

### Plan for Session 2

Per the per-task dependencies set up:

1. **First**: confirm test-suite result from Session 1's background run (capture in §1.5).
2. Install `cargo-llvm-cov` if missing.
3. Generate workspace coverage → `audit/COVERAGE_MAP.md`.
4. List `pub fn` functions with 0% line coverage, grouped by Tier.
5. Identify which crates have *no* test attributes at all (per §1.2 file-count gap).
6. Save crate-by-crate coverage table back into AUDIT_REPORT.md as §2.0 "Coverage baseline".

### Estimate vs. user's 1-2 week multi-session window

- Session 1: **done in this turn** (baseline + first 4 findings).
- Sessions 2: ~1 turn (coverage map).
- Sessions 3-5: ~3 turns (Tier 0 — biggest crate-by-crate effort).
- Sessions 6-7: ~2 turns (Tier 1).
- Sessions 8-9: ~2 turns (Tier 2 — needs Linux Docker setup).
- Session 10 + final: ~2 turns (Tier 3 + verdict).

Total: ~11 working sessions. Fits comfortably in 1-2 weeks.

### 1.6 Cross-cutting risk markers (raw, to be analyzed in later sessions)

| Risk marker | Count | Audit action |

## 2.0 Coverage baseline (Session 2, 2026-05-14)

Generated with `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --exclude sophis-rollup-host --exclude rollup-node --no-fail-fast --summary-only` (source-based instrumentation, LLVM 22 / `cargo-llvm-cov 0.8.7`). Full per-file table in `audit/coverage_full.txt` (700 lines).

### Workspace totals

- **Regions:** 66.08% (107,808/163,158)
- **Functions:** 59.94% (7,245/12,087) — **~40% of functions have zero coverage**
- **Lines:** 65.88% (60,025/91,116)
- **Branches:** unsupported by `cargo-llvm-cov 0.8.7` on this LLVM build (column reports `-`).

### By Tier

| Tier | Files | Lines covered | Functions covered | Regions covered | Zero-pct files | Sub-50% files |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **T0** — Consensus-critical | 153 | **77.33%** (19,277/24,927) | **68.20%** (2,052/3,009) | 77.10% (33,509/43,461) | 19 | 10 |
| **T1** — Operational security | 256 | **55.70%** (14,483/26,003) | **51.33%** (2,119/4,128) | 54.28% (25,309/46,631) | 76 | 40 |
| **T2** — ZK plumbing | 125 | **84.87%** (17,929/21,125) | **74.04%** (1,842/2,488) | 86.93% (34,980/40,238) | 6 | 7 |
| **T3** — UX/infra | 162 | 43.73% (8,336/19,061) | 50.04% (1,232/2,462) | 42.68% (14,010/32,828) | 52 | 28 |

**Reading.** T2 (ZK plumbing — Phase 3/5/6/9) is the best-tested category, reflecting the FIPS/RFC-grade witness validation and oracle-host AIR test density (~50 chips × multiple tests each). T0 (consensus) is the next-strongest at 77% lines, but has critical zero-pct files (F-5, F-6, F-7 below). T1 (operational) has the largest gap by absolute lines missed (11,520 lines uncovered) — protocol flow handlers and IBD code dominate. T3 low coverage is expected for binaries (faucet, explorer, dashboard, calculator, da-stress all have `main.rs` at 0% — these are exercised by smoke/manual testing, not unit tests).

### Tier 0 zero-coverage files (19 total)

| File | Lines | Fns | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|

### Tier 1 zero-coverage hot list (top 10 by line count)

These cluster heavily on protocol flows and binary mains:

```
protocol/flows/src/ibd/flow.rs                       611 lines, 61 fns — F-8

protocol/flows/src/v7/{ping,address}.rs              ~84 lines total
```

Detailed audit per-file deferred to Tier 1 sessions (6-7). Filed two collected findings here:
- **F-8 (P1)**: zero direct test coverage on Initial Block Download flow + v7 message handlers. IBD security is critical — a bug here lets an adversary stall or corrupt new-node sync.
- **F-9 (P2)**: CLI binaries (`dilithium-wallet`, `miner`) have 1,142 + 250 lines of `main.rs` code with zero direct unit tests. Acceptable if devnet integration tests exercise the user-visible code paths — to confirm in Tier 1.

### Session 2 findings — Tier 0 / Tier 1

#### F-5 — `sign_input_dilithium` has 0% direct test coverage (P0) ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** P0 — must fix before testnet (founder ratified Session 2, 2026-05-14).
**Found:** Session 2, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** ✅ **fixed in commit `1dcbbad` (Session 3, 2026-05-14)**. Added a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block in `consensus/core/src/sign.rs:60-188` with three unit tests:

1. **`test_sign_input_dilithium_round_trip`** — sign a single-input populated tx, verify the 2420-byte signature against the same sighash via `libcrux_ml_dsa::ml_dsa_44::verify`. Closes the sighash-binding / script-encoding bug class.
2. **`test_sign_input_dilithium_sighash_type_binding`** — sign with `SIG_HASH_ALL`, `SIG_HASH_NONE`, `SIG_HASH_SINGLE`; assert the three signatures differ pairwise and that the trailing hash-type byte echoes the requested variant. Closes the "signer ignores SigHashType" bug class.
3. **`test_sign_input_dilithium_randomness_nondeterminism`** — sign the same input twice with the same key; assert signatures differ (ML-DSA is hedged). Pins `libcrux_ml_dsa::SIGNING_RANDOMNESS_SIZE == 32` so a future libcrux upgrade changing the constant fails this test rather than the production signer. Closes the "randomness slice mis-sized" bug class.

Verification: `cargo test -p sophis-consensus-core sign::` → **3 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored**.

The tests reuse the same `PopulatedTransaction` / `Transaction` patterns as `consensus/core/src/hashing/sighash.rs::test_signature_hash`, so future sighash refactors will surface here as well.

**Description.** `consensus/core/src/sign.rs:30-58` defines `sign_input_dilithium`, the canonical function that:
1. Computes the sighash via `calc_signature_hash(tx, input_index, hash_type, &reused_values)`.
2. Loads the 2560-byte Dilithium-2 (ML-DSA-44) signing key into `MLDSA44SigningKey`.
3. Draws 32 bytes of `getrandom::getrandom` for ML-DSA randomness.
4. Calls `ml_dsa_44::sign(&sk, message, b"", randomness)`.
5. Builds the P2SH input script: `[0x4d, sig_len_lo, sig_len_hi, sig_bytes ‖ hash_type_byte]`.

`cargo-llvm-cov` shows **0/22 line coverage, 0/1 function coverage**. The function is called from **9 sites** in 5 binaries (`dilithium-wallet`, `tools/sophis-da-stress`, `testnet-faucet`, `oracle/relayer`, `rollup/sequencer`), and there is no `#[test]` in `consensus/core/src/sign.rs` itself or in any sibling test module that invokes it.

**Why this matters.**
- A bug in sighash binding silently invalidates every signed transaction (caller side) or accepts forged ones (verifier side). The verifier path *is* tested (via opcode `0xc4` Dilithium opcode tests in `txscript`), but the signer is not.
- The randomness sourcing (line 42-45) reads from `getrandom`. A bug that mis-sizes the slice or leaks the secret-key bytes through randomness would be invisible to a happy-path integration test that simply sends and confirms a tx.
- The script encoding (lines 50-56) hand-writes the OP_PUSHDATA2 prefix. A wrong endianness or a 1-byte slip silently produces an unspendable output that the signer cannot tell apart from a normal one.

**P0-vs-P1 rationale.**
- P0 view: this is consensus-critical code with zero test. Testnet should not launch without a round-trip vector.
- P1 view: the verifier side has exhaustive tests (libcrux ML-DSA-44 ships its own NIST-KAT verification) and integration via the rothschild-style traffic generator on devnet implicitly exercises the path. So a *catastrophic* bug would surface in the first 24 hours of testnet via "all txs rejected" symptoms.

**Recommended fix (minimum):** add three unit tests in `consensus/core/src/sign.rs#[cfg(test)]`:
1. **Round-trip** — generate a Dilithium keypair, sign a single-input tx, run the signature through the `txscript` Dilithium opcode verifier (or `libcrux_ml_dsa::ml_dsa_44::verify`), assert it accepts.
2. **SigHashType variation** — sign the same tx with each of the documented SigHashType variants, assert signatures differ.
3. **Determinism / randomness probe** — sign the same tx twice with the same key, assert signatures differ (because randomness is sampled). Bind explicitly to `libcrux::ml_dsa::SIGNING_RANDOMNESS_SIZE` so a future libcrux upgrade that changes the constant fails the test rather than the code.

#### F-6 — `pruning_proof/validate.rs` has 0% test coverage (P1)

**Severity:** P1 — must fix before mainnet (testnet-tolerable).
**Found:** Session 2, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** open, deeper analysis Session 3.

**Description.** `consensus/src/processes/pruning_proof/validate.rs` (251 lines, 17 fns) validates incoming pruning-point proofs during Initial Block Download. **Zero direct test coverage.** Workspace-wide grep confirms zero matches for the symbol in `testing/integration/**/*.rs` — no integration test exercises this path either.

The pruning-proof verifier is the gating mechanism for new nodes joining the network. An adversary peer that sneaks a malformed proof past it can fork a fresh node away from the canonical chain.

**Session 3 deeper finding.** This is *not* a simple unit-test gap. The function `validate_pruning_point_proof` takes a `&PruningPointProof` and `&PruningProofMetadata` and reads from 12+ RocksDB stores (`DbHeadersStore`, `DbGhostdagStore`, `DbReachabilityStore`, `DbRelationsStore`, …). The only way to produce a *valid* `PruningPointProof` is to:

1. Stand up a `TestConsensus` instance.
2. Mine a synthetic DAG of depth ≥ `pruning_depth` (which is a function of `finality_depth`; on the production 10-BPS network this is ≥ hundreds of thousands of blocks).
3. Trigger pruning so `build_pruning_point_proof` produces a proof.
4. Call `validate_pruning_point_proof` on that proof and assert OK.
5. Mutate the proof to hit each of 31 `PruningImportError` variants + 2 `ProofWeakness` variants.

Steps 2-3 are an integration-test scale of work. Existing helpers exist (`TestConsensus::add_header_only_block_with_parents`, `TestBlockBuilder::build_block_template_with_parents`) but no test currently builds a DAG anywhere near pruning depth.

**Recommended action (out of scope for Session 3):**

1. **Session 4 (dedicated)** — research the minimum DAG depth that produces a coherent pruning proof. **Session 3 follow-up:** `pruning_depth` is computed as `finality_depth + 2·merge_depth + 4·mergeset_size_limit·k + 2k + 2` (`consensus/core/src/config/bps.rs:96-107`). With the structural floors enforced by `Bps<BPS>` (`mergeset_size_limit ≥ 180`, `ghostdag_k ≥ 18` for BPS=1), the minimum coherent `pruning_depth` is approximately **13,094 blocks** even on BPS=1 — *not* the "≈ 32" originally floated. A useful integration test therefore needs either:
   - A multi-thousand-block synthetic DAG (slow but viable), or
   - Constants overrides at the workspace level (touching `bps.rs` floors, which has cross-cutting impact and would itself need a regression suite).

2. Once a tractable harness exists, add `consensus/src/processes/pruning_proof/tests.rs` with:
   - `test_validate_pruning_proof_round_trip` — happy path: build a proof on the synthetic DAG, validate it, assert OK.
   - `test_validate_pruning_proof_rejects_*` for each `PruningImportError` variant (31 variants → at least cover the 2 `ProofWeakness` variants first).
3. Coverage should reach ≥80% on `validate.rs` after.

**Pre-mainnet:** P1 gate. **Pre-testnet:** documented gap; testnet will exercise the path under real IBD with hundreds of joining nodes, which is itself a useful (if non-deterministic) test.

A scaffold `#[ignore]`d test has not been added to the codebase to avoid lying-about-coverage; this finding is the authoritative record. Estimate revised to **4-8 hours / dedicated session**, not the originally stated 2-3h.

#### F-7 — `pruning_proof/apply.rs` has 0% test coverage (P1)

**Severity:** P1 — must fix before mainnet (testnet-tolerable).
**Found:** Session 2, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** open, deeper analysis Session 3.

**Description.** `consensus/src/processes/pruning_proof/apply.rs` (137 lines, 10 fns) commits a validated pruning proof to local state during IBD. Sister to F-6.

**Session 3 deeper finding.** Same integration-harness constraint as F-6. Once F-6's tiny-pruning-params machinery exists, `apply.rs` becomes testable by the same harness: call `validate_pruning_point_proof` then `apply_proof` on the same proof and assert the resulting state matches expectations.

**Recommended action:** bundled with F-6's Session 4 work.

#### F-8 — IBD + v7 message handlers have 0% coverage (P1)

**Severity:** P1 — must fix before mainnet (testnet-tolerable with manual smoke).
**Found:** Session 2, 2026-05-14.
**Status:** open.

**Description.** `protocol/flows/src/ibd/{flow,negotiate,progress,streams}.rs` totals 858 lines / 82 fns, all 0%. The v7 family (`v7/{blockrelay,ping,address,request_*,*}`) adds another ~1,200 lines / 130 fns. These are the message handlers that govern how a fresh node syncs from peers. Bugs here typically manifest as IBD stalls or partial syncs — caught by devnet integration testing but not by unit tests.

**Action.** Tier 1 audit (Sessions 6-7) must inventory the v7 / v8 protocol surface, identify which messages have *no* integration test exercising them on devnet, and either add coverage or document the risk.

#### F-9 — CLI binary `main.rs` has 0% coverage (P2)

**Severity:** P2 — post-mainnet technical debt.
**Found:** Session 2, 2026-05-14.

**Description.** Several `*/src/main.rs` are 0% covered (most by-design):
- `dilithium-wallet/src/main.rs` — 1142 lines, 72 fns
- `miner/src/main.rs` — 250 lines, 8 fns
- `testnet-faucet/src/main.rs` — 0%
- `sophis-explorer/src/main.rs` — 0%
- `tools/sophis-*/src/main.rs` — 0%

These are end-user CLI binaries. Integration / smoke tests on devnet implicitly exercise them but no automated assertion holds. Acceptable for testnet; tightening requires either extracting logic into a `lib.rs` testable surface or building a CLI smoke-test harness.
